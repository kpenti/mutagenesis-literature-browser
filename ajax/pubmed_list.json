This class of binding proteins, both natural and synthetic, has a strong tendency to bind a preformed cleft using a convex binding interface (paratope). To explore their capacity to produce high-affinity interfaces with diverse shape and topography, we examined the interface energetics and explored the affinity limit achievable with a flat paratope. We chose a minimalist paratope limited to two loops found in a natural camelid heavy-chain antibody (VHH) that binds to ribonuclease A. Ala scanning of the VHH revealed only three \"hot spot\" side chains and additional four residues important for supporting backbone-mediated interactions. The small number of critical residues suggested that this is not an optimized paratope. <b>Using selection from synthetic combinatorial libraries, we enhanced its affinity by >100-fold, resulting in variants with Kd as low as 180 pM with no detectable loss of binding specificity<\/b>. High-resolution crystal structures revealed that the mutations induced only subtle structural changes but extended the network of interactions. This resulted in an expanded hot spot region including four additional residues located at the periphery of the paratope with a concomitant loss of the so-called \"O-ring\" arrangement of energetically inert residues. These results suggest that this class of simple, single-domain scaffolds is capable of generating high-performance binding interfaces with diverse shape. More generally, they suggest that highly functional interfaces can be designed without closely mimicking natural interfaces.","author":"Koide A","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2007.08.027","matches":"mutation, x-ray, crystallography, affinity, Kd"},"17420456":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Carrier Proteins, Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques, Crystallography, X-Ray, Fibronectins, Humans, Peptide Library, Protein Engineering, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","date_submitted":"2007 Apr 17","title":"High-affinity single-domain binding proteins with a binary-code interface.","abstract":"High degrees of sequence and conformation complexity found in natural protein interaction interfaces are generally considered essential for achieving tight and specific interactions.

To quantify a changed epitope for escaping from neutralizing antibodies is the basis for the antigenic drift and vaccine development.\n\nWe have developed an epitope-based method to identify the antigenic drift of influenza A utilizing the conformation changes on epitopes. A changed epitope, an antigenic site on HA with an accumulated conformation change to escape from neutralizing antibody, can be considered as a \"key feature\" for representing the antigenic drift. According to hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and HA\/antibody complex structures, we statistically measured the conformation change of an epitope by considering the number of critical position mutations with high genetic diversity and antigenic scores. Experimental results show that two critical position mutations can induce the conformation change of an epitope to escape from the antibody recognition. Among five epitopes of HA, epitopes A and B, which are near to the receptor binding site, play a key role for neutralizing antibodies. In addition, two changed epitopes often drive the antigenic drift and can explain the selections of 24 WHO vaccine strains.\n\nOur method is able to quantify the changed epitopes on HA for predicting the antigenic variants and providing biological insights to the vaccine updates.

We use a mathematical model of virus-antibody interaction to elucidate the conditions under which amino acid mutations to HA could lead to an increase in viral neutralization.

For hemagglutinin, several overlapping selective pressures can cause such concerted mutations, including the host immune response, ligand recognition and host specificity, and functional requirements for pH-induced activation and membrane fusion. Using sequence mutual information as a metric, we extracted clusters of concerted mutation sites and analyzed them in the context of crystallographic data. Comparison of influenza isolates from two subtypes--human H3N2 strains and human and avian H5N1 strains--yielded substantial differences in spatial localization of the clustered residues.

Consequently, the contribution of two hydrogen bonds was minor, and their abolition by mutation resulted in only a slight decrease in the affinity of the antibody for its antigen. By comparison, the other two hydrogen bonds buried at the interfacial area had large enthalpic advantage, despite entropic loss that was perhaps due to stiffening of the interface by the bonds, and were crucial to the strength of the interaction. Deletion of these strong hydrogen bonds could not be compensated for by other structural changes.

Here we have investigated intra- and intermolecular interactions in three antibody-protein complexes: theoretical models of HH8-HEL and HH26-HEL complexes, and the x-ray crystal structure of HH10-HEL complex. Our results show that HH8-HEL has the lowest number and HH26-HEL has the highest number of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The number of salt bridges is lowest in HH8-HEL and highest in HH26-HEL. The binding site salt bridges in HH8-HEL are not networked, and are weak, whereas, in HH26-HEL, an intramolecular salt-bridge triad at the binding site is networked to an intermolecular triad to form a pentad. The pentad and each salt bridge of this pentad are exceptionally stabilizing. The number of binding-site salt bridges and their strengths are intermediate in HH10-HEL, with an intramolecular triad. Our further calculations show that the electrostatic component contributes the most to binding energy of HH26-HEL, whereas the hydrophobic component contributes the most in the case of HH8-HEL. A \"hot-spot\" epitope residue Lys-97 forms an intermolecular salt bridge in HH8-HEL, and participates in the intermolecular pentad in the HH26-HEL complex.

Furthermore, the effect of mutating Lys-97 is most severe in HH26-HEL. Lys-96, being a charged residue, also contributes the most in HH26-HEL among the three complexes. The SPR results on these mutants also highlight that the apparent \"electrostatic steering\" on net on rates actually act at post-collision level stabilization of the complex. The significance of this work is the observed variations in electrostatic interactions among the three complexes.

Comparison of the structures of free and bound Fab HyHEL-63 reveals that several of the ordered water molecules in the free antibody-combining site are retained and that additional waters are added upon complex formation. The interface waters serve to increase shape and chemical complementarity by filling cavities between the interacting surfaces and by contributing to the hydrogen bonding network linking the antigen and antibody. Complementarity is further enhanced by small (<3 A) movements in the polypeptide backbones of certain antibody CDR loops, by rearrangements of side chains in the interface, and by a slight shift in the relative orientation of the V(L) and V(H) domains. The combining site residues of complexed Fab HyHEL-63 exhibit reduced temperature factors compared with those of the free Fab, suggesting a loss in conformational entropy upon binding. <b>To probe the relative contribution of individual antigen residues to complex stabilization, single alanine substitutions were introduced in the epitope of HEL recognized by HyHEL-63, and their effects on antibody affinity were measured using surface plasmon resonance<\/b>. <b>In agreement with the crystal structure, HEL residues at the center of the interface that are buried in the complex contribute most to the binding energetics (DeltaG(mutant) - DeltaG(wild type) > 3.0 kcal\/mol), whereas the apparent contributions of solvent-accessible residues at the periphery are much less pronounced (<1.5 kcal\/mol)<\/b>. In the latter case, the mutations may be partially compensated by local rearrangements in solvent structure that help preserve shape complementarity and the interface hydrogen bonding network.","author":"Li Y","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10828942","matches":"mutation, alanine, x-ray, crystallography, kcal, affinity"}},"10873857":{"22547613":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antimalarials, Binding Sites, Electron Transport Complex III, Plasmodium falciparum, Quinolones","date_submitted":"2012 Jul","title":"HDQ, a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum proliferation, binds to the quinone reduction site of the cytochrome bc1 complex.","abstract":"The mitochondrial bc(1) complex is a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c coupled to the vectorial translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The dipolar relaxation curves measured by EPR at Q-band in a glass state of frozen solution (i.e., under the conditions trapping a dynamic distribution of FeS positions that existed in a liquid phase) of isolated cytochrome bc(1) were compared with the curves calculated for the FeS cluster occupying distinct positions in various crystals of cytochrome bc(1). This comparison revealed the existence of a broad distribution of the FeS positions in noninhibited cytochrome bc(1) and demonstrated that the average equilibrium position is modifiable by inhibitors or mutations. To explain the results, we assume that changes in the equilibrium distribution of the FeS positions are the result of modifications of the orienting potential gradient in which the diffusion of the FeS head domain takes place.

The data strongly support a mechanism in which the Q(o)-site operates through a reaction in which the first electron transfer from ubiquinol to the oxidized iron-sulfur protein is the rate-determining step for the overall process. The reaction involves a proton-coupled electron transfer down a hydrogen bond between the ubiquinol and a histidine ligand of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, in which the unfavorable protonic configuration contributes a substantial part of the activation barrier. The reaction is endergonic, and the products are an unstable ubisemiquinone at the Q(o)-site, and the reduced iron-sulfur protein, the extrinsic mobile domain of which is now free to dissociate and move away from the site to deliver an electron to cyt c(1) and liberate the H(+). When oxidation of the semiquinone is prevented, it participates in bypass reactions, including superoxide generation if O(2) is available. When the b-heme chain is available as an acceptor, the semiquinone is oxidized in a process in which the proton is passed to the glutamate of the conserved -PEWY- sequence, and the semiquinone anion passes its electron to heme b(L) to form the product ubiquinone. The rate is rapid compared to the limiting reaction, and would require movement of the semiquinone closer to heme b(L) to enhance the rate constant. The acceptor reactions at the Q(i)-site are still controversial, but likely involve a \"two-electron gate\" in which a stable semiquinone stores an electron. Possible mechanisms to explain the cyt b(150) phenomenon are discussed, and the information from pulsed-EPR studies about the structure of the intermediate state is reviewed. The mechanism discussed is applicable to a monomeric bc(1) complex. We discuss evidence in the literature that has been interpreted as shown that the dimeric structure participates in a more complicated mechanism involving electron transfer across the dimer interface. We show from myxothiazol titrations and mutational analysis of Tyr-199, which is at the interface between monomers, that no such inter-monomer electron transfer is detected at the level of the b(L) hemes. We show from analysis of strains with mutations at Asn-221 that there are coulombic interactions between the b-hemes in a monomer. The data can also be interpreted as showing similar coulombic interaction across the dimer interface, and we discuss mechanistic implications.","author":"Crofts AR","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbabio.2008.04.037","matches":"mutation"},"18498758":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Culture Media, Cytochromes b, Electron Transport Complex III, Electron Transport Complex IV, Fermentation, Genes, Fungal, Genetic Vectors, Introns, Mitochondria, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Transaminases","date_submitted":"2008 Sep","title":"Introduction of cytochrome b mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a method that allows selection for both functional and non-functional cytochrome b proteins.","abstract":"We have previously used inhibitors interacting with the Qn site of the yeast cytochrome bc(1) complex to obtain yeast strains with resistance-conferring mutations in cytochrome b as a means to investigate the effects of amino acid substitutions on Qn site enzymatic activity [M.G.

This model argues in favor of a role of Oxa1p in the insertion and the lateral exit of less hydrophobic TM domains from the translocation site into the lipid bilayer.","author":"Saint-Georges Y","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.251503098","matches":"mutation"}},"11080628":{"23620741":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Capsid, Crystallography, X-Ray, HIV Antibodies, HIV Core Protein p24, HIV-1, Humans, Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Protein Binding, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Solutions, Virus Assembly","date_submitted":"2013","title":"Structure of a novel shoulder-to-shoulder p24 dimer in complex with the broad-spectrum antibody A10F9 and its implication in capsid assembly.","abstract":"Mature HIV-1 viral particles assemble as a fullerene configuration comprising p24 capsid hexamers, pentamers and dimers.

In the wild-type complex, V(L)W92 occupies a large hydrophobic pocket on the surface of HEL and constitutes an energetic \"hot spot\" for antigen binding. The losses in apolar buried surface area in the mutant complexes, relative to wild-type, range from 25 (V(L)F92) to 115 A(2) (V(L)A92), with no significant shifts in the positions of protein atoms at the mutation site for any of the complexes except V(L)A92, where there is a peptide flip. The affinities of the mutant Fv fragments for HEL are 10-100-fold lower than that of the original antibody. Formation of all six mutant complexes is marked by a decrease in binding enthalpy that exceeds the decrease in binding free energy, such that the loss in enthalpy is partly offset by a compensating gain in entropy. No correlation was observed between decreases in apolar, polar, or aggregate (sum of the apolar and polar) buried surface area in the V(L)92 mutant series and changes in the enthalpy of formation. Conversely, there exist linear correlations between losses of apolar buried surface and decreases in binding free energy (R(2) = 0.937) as well as increases in the solvent portion of the entropy of binding (R(2) = 0.909). The correlation between binding free energy and apolar buried surface area corresponds to 21 cal mol(-1) A(-2) (1 cal = 4.185 J) for the effective hydrophobicity at the V(L)92 mutation site. Furthermore, the slope of the line defined by the correlation between changes in binding free energy and solvent entropy approaches unity, demonstrating that the exclusion of solvent from the binding interface is the predominant energetic factor in the formation of this protein complex. Our estimate of the hydrophobic contribution to binding at site V(L)92 in the D1.3-HEL interface is consistent with values for the hydrophobic effect derived from classical hydrocarbon solubility models.

Initially, nAbs targeted a single region of gp120, which flanked the V3 domain and involved the alpha2 helix. A single amino acid change at one of three positions in this region conferred early escape. One immunoglobulin heavy chain and two light chains recovered from autologous B cells comprised two mAbs, 19.3H-L1 and 19.3H-L3, which neutralized the founder Env along with one or three of the early escape variants carrying these mutations, respectively. Neither mAb neutralized later nAb escape or heterologous Envs. Crystal structures of the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) revealed flat epitope contact surfaces, where minimal light chain mutation in 19.3H-L3 allowed for additional antigenic interactions. Resistance to mAb neutralization arose in later Envs through alteration of two glycans spatially adjacent to the initial escape signatures. The cross-neutralizing nAbs that ultimately developed failed to target any of the defined V3-proximal changes generated during the first year of infection in this subject. Our data demonstrate that this subject's first recognized nAb epitope elicited strain-specific mAbs, which incrementally acquired autologous breadth, and directed later B cell responses to target distinct portions of Env. This immune re-focusing could have triggered the evolution of cross-clade antibodies and suggests that exposure to a specific sequence of immune escape variants might promote broad humoral responses during HIV-1 infection.","author":"Murphy MK","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1003173","matches":"mutation"},"23008694":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"","date_submitted":"2011","title":"Systematic protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics studies of HIV-1 gp120 and CD4: insights for new drug development.","abstract":"The interactions between HIV-1 gp120 and mutated CD4 proteins were investigated in order to identify a lead structure for therapy based on competitive blocking of the HIV binding receptor for human T-cells.

Samples were divided at the outset into hypothesis-forming and validation sets, and we used phylogenetically corrected statistical strategies to identify signatures, systematically scanning all of Env. Signatures included single amino acids, glycosylation motifs, and multi-site patterns based on functional or structural groupings of amino acids. We identified signatures near the CCR5 co-receptor-binding region, near the CD4 binding site, and in the signal peptide and cytoplasmic domain, which may influence Env expression and processing. Two signatures patterns associated with transmission were particularly interesting. The first was the most statistically robust signature, located in position 12 in the signal peptide. The second was the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site at positions 413-415; the presence of this site has been recently found to be associated with escape from potent and broad neutralizing antibodies, consistent with enabling a common pathway for immune escape during chronic infection. Its recurrent loss in early infection suggests it may impact fitness at the time of transmission or during early viral expansion. The signature patterns we identified implicate Env expression levels in selection at viral transmission or in early expansion, and suggest that immune evasion patterns that recur in many individuals during chronic infection when antibodies are present can be selected against when the infection is being established prior to the adaptive immune response.","author":"Gnanakaran S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002209","matches":"mutation"},"21807049":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Animals, Antibodies, Neutralizing, Cell Line, Transformed, Germ-Line Mutation, HEK293 Cells, HIV Antibodies, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Macaca mulatta, env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2011 Sep 16","title":"Putative rhesus macaque germline predecessors of human broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies: differences from the human counterparts and implications for HIV-1 vaccine development.","abstract":"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are likely to be a key component of protective immunity conferred by an effective HIV-1 vaccine.

The basis for this stabilization is usually assigned to intrinsic structural features of the open pore.

Large impermeant intracellular cations such as N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG(+)) and tetraethylammonium cause severe slowing of channel closure and gating currents, whereas the smaller cation, Cs(+), displays a more moderate effect on voltage sensor return. A nonconducting mutant also displays significant open state stabilization in the presence of intracellular K(+), suggesting that K(+) ions in the intracellular cavity also slow pore closure. A mutation in the S6 segment used previously to enlarge the inner cavity (Kv1.2-I402C) relieves the slowing of OFF gating currents in the presence of the large NMG(+) ion, suggesting that the interaction site for stabilizing ions resides within the inner cavity and creates an energetic barrier to pore closure. The physiological significance of ionic occupation of the inner cavity is underscored by the threefold slowing of ionic current deactivation in the wild-type channel compared with Kv1.2-I402C. The data suggest that internal ions, including physiological concentrations of K(+), allosterically regulate the deactivation kinetics of the Kv1.2 channel by impairing pore closure and limiting the return of voltage sensors.

For NH(4)(+), the permeability was reduced more with smaller changes in i(max) (3.7 pA) and K(m) (16 mM). We assessed the role of a site near the outer mouth of channel in the saturation process. This site could be occupied by either permeant ions or low-affinity blocking ions such as Na(+), Li(+), Mg(2+), and Ca(2+) with similar voltage dependence (apparent valence, 0.15-0.20). It prefers Mg(2+) over Ca(2+) and has a monovalent cation selectivity, based on the ability to displace Mg(2+), of K(+) > Li(+) \u223c Na(+) > Rb(+) \u223c NH(4)(+). Conversely, in the presence of Mg(2+), the K(m) for K(+) conductance was substantially increased. The ability of Mg(2+) to block the channels was reduced when four negatively charged amino acids in the extracellular domain of the channel were mutated to neutral residues.

We now corroborate this hypothesis by transplanting the TASK-2 extracellular pH (pH(o)) sensor in the background of a pH(o)-insensitive TASK-3 channel, which leads to the restitution of pH(o)-gating. Using a concatenated channel approach, we also demonstrate that for TASK-2 to open, pH(o) sensors must be neutralized in each of the two subunits forming these dimeric channels with no apparent cross-talk between the sensors. These results are consistent with adaptive biasing force analysis of K(+) permeation using a model selectivity filter in wild-type and mutated channels. The underlying free-energy profiles confirm that either a doubly or a singly charged pH(o) sensor is sufficient to abolish ion flow. Atomic detail of the associated mechanism reveals that, rather than a collapse of the pore, as proposed for other K(2P) channels gated at the selectivity filter, an increased height of the energetic barriers for ion translocation accounts for channel blockade at acid pH(o).

Here, we identify the mechanistic principles by which movements on the inner bundle gate trigger conformational changes at the selectivity filter, leading to the non-conductive C-type inactivated state. Analysis of a series of KcsA open structures suggests that, as a consequence of the hinge-bending and rotation of the TM2 helix, the aromatic ring of Phe 103 tilts towards residues Thr 74 and Thr 75 in the pore-helix and towards Ile 100 in the neighbouring subunit. This allows the network of hydrogen bonds among residues Trp 67, Glu 71 and Asp 80 to destabilize the selectivity filter, allowing entry to its non-conductive conformation. Mutations at position 103 have a size-dependent effect on gating kinetics: small side-chain substitutions F103A and F103C severely impair inactivation kinetics, whereas larger side chains such as F103W have more subtle effects. This suggests that the allosteric coupling between the inner helical bundle and the selectivity filter might rely on straightforward mechanical deformation propagated through a network of steric contacts.

Differences in the P-loop sequence of HCN channels (eg. the pore-lining sequence L478C479IGYG) suggest these residues could account for differences in selectivity between these channel families. Despite being expressed, L478T\/C479T HCN4 channels did not produce current. Since threonine in the second position is highly conserved in K+ channels, we also studied C479T channels. Based on permeability ratios (PX\/PK), C479T HCN4 channels (K+(1)>Rb+(0.85)>Cs+(0.59)>Li+(0.50)>or=Na+(0.49)) were less selective than WT rabbit HCN4 (K+(1)>Rb+(0.48)>Cs+(0.31)>or=Na+(0.29)>Li+(0.03)), indicating that the TIGYG sequence is insufficient to confer K+ selectivity to HCN channels. C479T HCN4 channels had an increased permeability to large organic cations than WT HCN4 channels, as well as increased unitary K+ conductance, and altered channel gating. Collectively, these results suggest that HCN4 channels have larger pores than K+ channels and replacement of the cysteine at position 479 with threonine further increases pore size. Furthermore, selected mutations in other regions linked previously to pore stability in K+ channels (ie. S475D, S475E and F471W\/K472W) were also unable to confer K+ selectivity to C479T HCN4 channels.

The classical mechanism proposed for the slow inactivation observed in cell-free membrane patches--the so called C inactivation--is a constriction of the external mouth of the channel pore that prevents K(+) ion conduction. This constriction is antagonized by the external application of the pore blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). In contrast to C inactivation, here we show that, when recorded in whole Xenopus oocytes, slow inactivation kinetics in Shaker IR K channels is poorly dependent on external TEA but severely delayed by internal TEA. Based on the antagonism with internally or externally added TEA, we used a two-pulse protocol to show that half of the channels inactivate by way of a gate sensitive to internal TEA. Such gate had a recovery time course in the tens of milliseconds range when the interpulse voltage was -90 mV, whereas C-inactivated channels took several seconds to recover. Internal TEA also reduced gating charge conversion associated to slow inactivation, suggesting that the closing of the internal TEA-sensitive inactivation gate could be associated with a significant amount of charge exchange of this type. We interpreted our data assuming that binding of internal TEA antagonized with U-type inactivation (Klemic, K.G., G.E. Kirsch, and S.W. Jones. 2001. Biophys. J. 81:814-826). Our results are consistent with a direct steric interference of internal TEA with an internally located slow inactivation gate as a \"foot in the door\" mechanism, implying a significant functional overlap between the gate of the internal TEA-sensitive slow inactivation and the primary activation gate. But, because U-type inactivation is reduced by channel opening, trapping the channel in the open conformation by TEA would also yield to an allosteric delay of slow inactivation.

Decomposition of the static field provides a list of residues that display remarkable correspondence with existing mutagenesis data identifying amino acids that affect conduction and rectification. Many of these residues demonstrate interactions with the ion over long distances, up to 40 A, suggesting that mutations potentially affect ion or blocker energetics over the entire pore.

It is likely that responses both to voltage and pH changes involve gating at the selectivity filter.","author":"Yuill KH","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00424-007-0282-7","matches":"mutation"},"17142267":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Anions, Binding Sites, Cell Line, Chlorides, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, Cyanates, Cyanides, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator, Gold, Gold Compounds, Ion Channel Gating, Permeability, Platinum Compounds, Point Mutation","date_submitted":"2007 Feb 15","title":"On the origin of asymmetric interactions between permeant anions and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel pore.","abstract":"Single channel and macroscopic current recording was used to investigate block of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel pore by the permeant anion Au(CN)2(-).

Generally, this selectivity is attributed to a narrow stretch of the channel known as the selectivity filter. Over this stretch ions are dehydrated, and the backbone oxygen atoms of the protein mimic the ion's loss of coordination by water. However, channels are long pores with spatially distinct ion-binding sites that all must be traversed during ion permeation. We have shown that selectivity of mutant Kir3.2 (GIRK2) channels can be substantially amplified by introducing acidic residues into the cavity, a binding site below the selectivity filter. Here, we carry out electrostatic calculations on homology models to quantify the degree of stabilization that these mutations have on ions in the cavity. We then construct a multiion model of ion permeation to calculate the channel's permeability to potassium relative to sodium. This kinetic model uses rates derived from the electrostatic calculations and demonstrates that nonselective electrostatic stabilization of cations in the cavity can amplify channel selectivity independently of the selectivity filter. This nonintuitive result highlights the dependence of channel properties on the entire channel architecture and suggests that selectivity may not be fully understood by focusing solely on thermodynamic considerations of ion dehydration and the energetics of the selectivity filter.","author":"Grabe M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0606662103","matches":"mutation"},"16873407":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Motifs, Animals, Female, Ion Channel Gating, Mathematics, Membrane Potentials, Mutation, Oocytes, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Porins, Protein Conformation, Sodium Channels, Xenopus laevis","date_submitted":"2006 Nov 1","title":"A conserved ring of charge in mammalian Na+ channels: a molecular regulator of the outer pore conformation during slow inactivation.","abstract":"The molecular mechanisms underlying slow inactivation in sodium channels are elusive.

A single point mutation of the negatively charged pore loop (P-loop) glutamate (E342) to either a positively charged lysine or arginine resulted in functional channels, which consistently responded to cGMP, although the currents were generally extremely small. The concentration-response curve of the lysine mutant channel was very similar to that of wild-type (WT) channels, suggesting no major structural alteration to the mutant channels. Reversal potential measurements, during cytoplasmic NaCl dilutions, showed that the lysine and the arginine mutations switched the selectivity of the channel from cations (P(Cl)\/P(Na) = 0.07 [WT]) to anions (P(Cl)\/P(Na) = 14 [Lys] or 10 [Arg]). Relative anion permeability sequences for the two mutant channels, measured with bi-ionic substitutions, were NO(3)(-) > I(-) > Br(-) > Cl(-) > F(-) > acetate(-), the same as those obtained for anion-selective GABA and glycine channels. The mutant channels also seem to have an extremely small single-channel conductance, measured using noise analysis of about 1-2 pS, compared to a WT value of about 29 pS. The results showed that it is predominantly the charge of the E342 residue in the P-loop, rather than the pore helix dipoles, which controls the cation-anion selectivity of this channel. However, the outward rectification displayed by both mutant channels in symmetrical NaCl solutions suggests that the negative ends of the pore helix dipoles may play a role in reducing the outward movement of Cl(-) ions through these anion-selective channels.

We used two independent ways to isolate the channels in the activated-not-open state. First, we used mutations in S4 (ILT; Smith-Maxwell, C.J., J.L. Ledwell, and R.W. Aldrich. 1998. J. Gen.

Second, we used the open channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which has been proposed to promote closure of the intracellular gate and thus specifically to stabilize the activated-not-open state of the channels. Supporting this proposed mechanism, we found that 4-AP enters channels only after opening, remaining trapped in closed channels, and that in the open state it competes with tetraethylammonium for binding. Using these tools, we found that in the activated-not-open state, a cysteine located at a position considered to form part of the gate (Shaker 478) showed higher reactivity than in either the open or the resting closed states. Additionally, we have found that in this activated state the intracellular gate continued to prevent access to the pore by molecules as small as Cd2+ ions. Our results suggest that the intracellular opening to the pore undergoes some rearrangements in the transition from the resting closed state to the activated-not-open state, but throughout this process the intracellular gate remains an effective barrier to the movement of potassium ions through the pore.","author":"del Camino D","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200509385","matches":"mutation"},"16143634":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Biophysics, CHO Cells, Calcium, Cations, Cricetinae, Cytosol, Ions, Membrane Potentials, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Oocytes, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Permeability, Potassium, Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated, Rats, Sodium, Xenopus","date_submitted":"2005 Nov","title":"Sodium permeability of a cloned small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel.","abstract":"Small-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SK(Ca) channels) are heteromeric complexes of pore-forming main subunits and constitutively bound calmodulin.

In the Kir3.1\/Kir3.4 channel, mutation of an extracellular arginine residue, R155, in the Kir3.4 subunit markedly reduced K+ activation of the channel.

Mutation of an extracellular histidine residue, H508, that mediates the inhibitory effect of protons on Kv1.4 current, abolished both K+ activation and the enhancement of K+ activation at acidic pH.

Sigg, S. Ciani, L. Toro, E. Stefani, and R. Olcese. 2004. J. Gen. Physiol. 124:173-184). Upon depolarizations, the D292N mutant elicited mostly gating current, followed by small or no ionic current, at voltages where the wild-type hSlo channel displayed robust ionic current. In fact, while the voltage dependence of the gating current was not significantly affected by the mutation, the overall activation curve was shifted by approximately 20 mV toward more depolarized potentials. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mutation prevents population of certain open states that in the wild type lead to high open probability. The activation curves of WT and D292N can both be fitted to the sum of two Boltzmann distributions with identical slope factors and half activation potentials, just by changing their relative amplitudes. The steeper and more negative component of the activation curve was drastically reduced by the D292N mutation (from 0.65 to 0.30), suggesting that the population of open states that occurs early in the activation pathway is reduced. Furthermore, the slow component of the gating current, which has been suggested to reflect transitions from closed to open states, was greatly reduced in D292N channels. The D292N mutation also affected the limiting open probability: at 0 mV, the limiting open probability dropped from approximately 0.5 for the wild-type channel to 0.06 in D292N (in 1 mM [Ca2+]i).

In the S79 mutants, SCN(-) did not block Cl(-) conductance. This suggested that the S79C mutation altered the affinity of an anion binding site for SCN(-). Additional evidence that S79 was located in the conduction pathway was provided by the finding that modification of the sulfhydryl group in S79C with MTSET(+) or MTSES(-) increased conductance significantly. Because the effect of positively and negatively charged MTS reagents was similar, electrostatic interactions between the permeant anion and the channel at this residue were probably not critical in anion selectivity.

Whole-cell and single-channel recordings demonstrated a modulation of heterologously expressed KCNQ2\/3 channels by extracellular H+ ions. KCNQ2\/3 current was inhibited by H+ ions with an IC50 of 52 nM (pH 7.3) at -60 mV, rising to 2 microM (pH 5.7) at -10 mV. Neuronal M-current exhibited a similar sensitivity. Extracellular H+ ions affected two distinct properties of KCNQ2\/3 current: the maximum current attainable upon depolarization (Imax) and the voltage dependence of steady-state activation. Reduction of Imax was antagonized by extracellular K+ ions and affected by mutations within the outer-pore turret, indicating an outer-pore based process. This reduction of Imax was shown to be due primarily to a decrease in the maximum open-probability of single KCNQ2\/3 channels. Single-channel open times were shortened by acidosis (pH 5.9), while closed times were increased. Acidosis also recruited a longer-lasting closed state, and caused a switch of single-channel activity from the full-conductance state ( approximately 8 pS) to a subconductance state ( approximately 5 pS). A depolarizing shift in the activation curve of macroscopic KCNQ2\/3 currents and single KCNQ2\/3 channels was caused by acidosis, while alkalosis caused a hyperpolarizing shift. Activation and deactivation kinetics were slowed by acidosis, indicating specific effects of H+ ions on elements involved in gating. Contrasting modulation of homomeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 currents revealed that high sensitivity to H+ ions was conferred by the KCNQ3 subunit.","author":"Prole DL","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200308897","matches":"mutation"},"14610019":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Anions, CHO Cells, Cell Line, Cricetinae, Cyanates, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Gold, Humans, Mutation, Permeability","date_submitted":"2003 Dec","title":"Mutation-induced blocker permeability and multiion block of the CFTR chloride channel pore.","abstract":"Chloride permeation through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is blocked by a broad range of anions that bind tightly within the pore.

Relief of block in F337A by Pt(NO2)42- permeation was only observed for blocker concentrations above 300 microM; as a result, block at very negative voltages showed an anomalous concentration dependence, with an increase in blocker concentration causing a significant weakening of block and an increase in Cl- current.

The fractional residual current through the bound channel changes with pH according to a single-site titration curve for toxin derivatives R13E and R13H, reflecting the effect of changing the charge on residue 13, in the bound state.

The effect of the pore helix on the open state of the channel is qualitatively similar to that of two well-characterized mutations at the second transmembrane domain (TM2), which stabilize the channel in its activated state.

Moreover, in sharp contrast to the two TM2 mutations, the pore helix mutation did not affect the functionality of the agonist-responsive gate.

We constructed 16 mutant channels, each one containing a cysteine mutation at one of the positions between 384 and 399 in the S6 region of the pore. By measuring currents activated by saturating concentrations of the full agonist cGMP and the partial agonists cIMP and cAMP, we show that mutating S6 residues to cysteine caused both favorable and unfavorable changes in the free energy of channel opening. The time course of cysteine modification with 2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate hydrochloride (MTSEA) was complex.

A model where modification affected both gating and permeation successfully reproduced the complex time course of modification for most of the mutant channels.

At many S6 cysteines, modification by MTSEA caused a decrease in conductance and a favorable change in the free energy of channel opening.

When MinK position 55 is mutated to cysteine (MinK-55C), I(Ks) channels can be blocked by external cadmium (Cd(2+)). We have supported a pore-associated location for MinK-55C because Cd(2+) block is sensitive to voltage, permeant ions on the opposite side of the membrane (trans-ions), and external tetraethylammonium (TEA), an I(Ks) pore-blocker. Two recent reports argue that MinK-55C is distant from the pore: one finds TEA does not affect Cd(2+) block if channels are formed with a KCNQ1 mutant (K318I, V319Y) that increases TEA affinity; the second proposes that Cd(2+) binds between MinK-55C and a cysteine in KCNQ1 that is posited to lie toward the channel periphery. Here, these discrepancies are considered. First, Cd(2+) block of MinK-55C channels formed with wild-type KCNQ1 is shown to depend not only on voltage and trans-ions but state (showing decreased on-rate with increased open time and blocker trapping on channel closure). Conversely, MinK-55C channels with K318I, V319Y KCNQ1 are found to demonstrate Cd(2+) block that is independent of voltage, trans-ions and state (and to have a lower unitary conductance): thus, the KCNQ1 mutations alter the process under study, yielding Cd(2+) inhibition that is pore-independent and, perforce, TEA-insensitive. Second, MinK-55C channels are found to remain sensitive to Cd(2+) despite mutation of any single native cysteine in KCNQ1 or all nine simultaneously; this suggests no KCNQ1 cysteine binds Cd(2+) and can serve to localize MinK-55C. Despite many concerns that are enumerated, we remain obliged to conclude that Cd(2+) enters and leaves the pore to reach MinK-55C, placing that residue in or near the pore.","author":"Chen H","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0006-3495(03)75097-8","matches":"mutation, mutate, affinity"},"12679372":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Anions, Arginine, Binding Sites, Cricetinae, Cyanates, Cyanides, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator, Electrophysiology, Gold, Gold Compounds, Humans, Intracellular Membranes, Molecular Structure, Mutation","date_submitted":"2003 Jun 1","title":"Molecular determinants and role of an anion binding site in the external mouth of the CFTR chloride channel pore.","abstract":"Chloride permeation through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is blocked by highly lyotropic permeant anions which bind tightly within the pore.

Fixed positive charge at this site appears to play a role in Au(CN)2- binding, as judged by multiple substitutions of differently charged amino acid side chains and also by the pH dependence of block conferred by the R334H mutant. However, non-charge-dependent effects also appear to contribute to Au(CN)2- binding. Mutation of R334 also disrupts the apparent electrostatic interaction between intracellular Au(CN)2- ions and extracellular permeant anions, an interaction which normally acts to relieve channel block. All six mutations studied at R334 significantly weakened this interaction, suggesting that arginine possesses a unique ability to coordinate ion-ion interactions at this site in the pore. Our results suggest that lyotropic anions bind tightly to a site in the outer mouth of the CFTR pore that involves interaction with a fixed positive charge. Binding to this site is also involved in coordination of multiple permeant anions within the pore, suggesting that anion binding in the outer mouth of the pore is an important aspect in the normal anion permeation mechanism.","author":"Gong X","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1113\/jphysiol.2002.038232","matches":"mutation"},"12668443":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Cell Membrane Permeability, Computer Simulation, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, Lipid Bilayers, Mammals, Membrane Fluidity, Models, Molecular, Phosphatidylcholines, Porosity, Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying, Protein Conformation, Recombinant Proteins, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Structure-Activity Relationship, Water","date_submitted":"2003 Apr","title":"Filter flexibility in a mammalian K channel: models and simulations of Kir6.2 mutants.","abstract":"The single-channel conductance varies significantly between different members of the inward rectifier (Kir) family of potassium channels.

We have used homology modeling (based on a KcsA template) combined with molecular dynamics simulations in a phosphatidycholine bilayer to explore whether changes in structural dynamics of the filter were induced by three such mutations: V127T, M137C, and G135F. Overall, 12 simulations of Kir6.2 models, corresponding to a total simulation time of 27 ns, have been performed. In these simulations we focused on distortions of the selectivity filter, and on the presence\/absence of water molecules lying behind the filter, which form interactions with the filter and the remainder of the protein. Relative to the wild-type simulation, the V127T mutant showed significant distortion of the filter such that approximately 50% of the simulation time was spent in a closed conformation. While in this conformation, translocation of K(+) ions between sites S1 and S2 was blocked. The distorted filter conformation resembles that of the bacterial channel KcsA when crystallized in the presence of a low [K(+)].

The extreme sharpness of this rectification reflects strong voltage dependence (apparent valence is approximately 5) of channel block by long polyamines. To understand the mechanism by which polyamines cause rectification, we examined IRK1 (Kir2.1) block by a series of bis-alkyl-amines (bis-amines) and mono-alkyl-amines (mono-amines) of varying length. The apparent affinity of channel block by both types of alkylamines increases with chain length. Mutation D172N in the second transmembrane segment reduces the channel's affinity significantly for long bis-amines, but only slightly for short ones (or for mono-amines of any length), whereas a double COOH-terminal mutation (E224G and E299S) moderately reduces the affinity for all bis-amines. The apparent valence of channel block increases from approximately 2 for short amines to saturate at approximately 5 for long bis-amines or at approximately 4 for long mono-amines. On the basis of these and other observations, we propose that to block the channel pore one amine group in all alkylamines tested binds near the same internal locus formed by the COOH terminus, while the other amine group of bis-amines, or the alkyl tail of mono-amines, \"crawls\" toward residue D172 and \"pushes\" up to 4 or 5 K+ ions outwardly across the narrow K+ selectivity filter. The strong voltage dependence of channel block therefore reflects the movement of charges carried across the transmembrane electrical field primarily by K+ ions, not by the amine molecule itself, as K+ ions and the amine blocker displace each other during block and unblock of the pore. This simple displacement model readily accounts for the classical observation that, at a given concentration of intracellular K+, rectification is apparently related to the difference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential for K+ ions rather than to the membrane potential itself.","author":"Guo D","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200208771","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"12601159":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester, Adenosine Triphosphate, Animals, Calcium Channel Agonists, Calcium Channels, Calcium Channels, L-Type, Cell Line, Cell Membrane, Cricetinae, Dihydropyridines, Electrophysiology, Enzyme Inhibitors, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Mutation, Okadaic Acid, Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, Phosphorylation, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Secondary, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Rabbits, Serine, Threonine, Time Factors, Transfection","date_submitted":"2003 Mar 4","title":"Modulation of cardiac Ca(V)1.2 channels by dihydropyridine and phosphatase inhibitor requires Ser-1142 in the domain III pore loop.","abstract":"Dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-activated calcium channels respond to membrane depolarization with two distinct modes of activity: short bursts of very short openings (mode 1) or repetitive openings of much longer duration (mode 2).

The negative charge proved to be crucial since the Glu125Asp (E125D) mutant showed similar properties to the wild type (WT).

We additionally observed that the speed of Ba2+o block and recovery was decelerated by the presence of Mg2+o in WT, but not in the E125Q mutant. The sensitivity to the block by Mg2+o was increased by lowering extracellular K(+) (K+o), suggesting a competitive interaction of Mg2+o and K+o.

The extracellular constriction is the selectivity filter, whereas the intracellular bundle crossing is proposed to act as the activation gate that opens in response to a depolarization. This four-helix bundle crossing is composed of S6 transmembrane segments, one contributed by each subunit. Here, we explore the cytoplasmic extension of the S6 transmembrane segment of Shaker potassium channels, just downstream from the bundle crossing. We substituted cysteine for each residue from N482 to T489 and determined the amplitudes of single channel currents and maximum open probability (P(o,max)) at depolarized voltages using nonstationary noise analysis. One mutant, F484C, significantly reduces P(o,max), whereas Y483C, F484C, and most notably Y485C, reduce single channel conductance (gamma). Mutations of residue Y485 have no effect on the Rb(+)\/K(+) selectivity, suggesting a local effect on gamma rather than an allosteric effect on the selectivity filter. Y485 mutations also reduce pore block by tetrabutylammonium, apparently by increasing the energy barrier for blocker movement through the open activation gate. Replacing Rb(+) ions for K(+) ions reduces the amplitude of single channel currents and makes gamma insensitive to mutations of Y485. These results suggest that Rb(+) ions increase an extracellular energy barrier, presumably at the selectivity filter, thus making it rate limiting for flux of permeant ions.

These transporters have an eight-helix structure and are characterized by highly conserved segments with polar or charged amino acid residues in transmembrane domains (TMDs) II, III, V, and VI. Two histidine residues in a Ni2+ binding motif, the signature sequence of NiCoTs, in TMD II of HoxN have been shown to be crucial for activity. Replacement of the corresponding His residues in NhlF affected both Co2+ and Ni2+ uptake, demonstrating that NhlF employs a HoxN-like mechanism for transport of the two cations. Multiple alignments of bacterial NiCoT sequences identified a striking correlation between a hydrophobic residue (Val or Phe) in TMD II and a position in the center of TMD I occupied by either an Asn (as in HoxN) or a His (as in NhlF). Introducing an isoleucine residue at the latter position strongly reduced HoxN activity and abolished NhlF activity, suggesting that a Lewis base N-donor moiety is important. The Asn-to-His exchange had no effect on HoxN, whereas the converse replacement reduced NhlF-mediated Ni2+ uptake significantly. Replacement of the entire TMD I of HoxN by the respective NhlF segment resulted in a chimera that transported Ni2+ and Co2+ with low capacity. The Val-to-Phe exchange in TMD II of HoxN led to a considerable rise in Ni2+ uptake capacity and conferred to the variant the ability to transport Co2+. NhlF activity dropped in response to the converse mutation. Our data predict that TMDs I and II in NiCoTs spatially interact to form a critical part of the selectivity filter.

To understand the molecular basis of this difference we constructed a series of AtHKT1\/HKT1 chimeras and introduced point mutations to AtHKT1 and wheat HKT1 at positions predicted to be critical for K(+) selectivity.

This glycine in P-loop A of AtHKT1 and HKT1 can be modeled as the first glycine of the K(+) channel selectivity filter GYG motif. The importance of such filter glycines for K(+) selectivity was confirmed by interconversion of Ser-88 and Gly-88 in the rice paralogues OsHKT1 and OsHKT2.

It remained unclear, however, whether these lipid structures are representative of the positions of unconstrained lipids surrounding an individual protein, and what molecular determinants define the lipid positions around AQP0. We addressed these questions by using molecular dynamics simulations and crystallographic refinement, and calculated time-averaged densities of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine lipids around AQP0. Our simulations demonstrate that, although the experimentally determined crystallographic lipid positions are constrained by the crystal packing, they appropriately describe the behavior of unconstrained lipids around an individual AQP0 tetramer, and thus likely represent physiologically relevant lipid positions.While the acyl chains were well localized, the lipid head groups were not. Furthermore, in silico mutations showed that electrostatic interactions do not play a major role attracting these phospholipids towards AQP0. Instead, the mobility of the protein crucially modulates the lipid localization and explains the difference in lipid density between extracellular and cytoplasmic leaflets. Moreover, our simulations support a general mechanism in which membrane proteins laterally diffuse accompanied by several layers of localized lipids, with the positions of the annular lipids being influenced the most by the protein surface. We conclude that the acyl chains rather than the head groups define the positions of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine lipids around AQP0.

ERBB2\/HER2, best known for its role in breast cancer tumorigenesis, can be targeted by two types of pharmacological manipulation: antibody therapy against the extracellular receptor domain and small molecule compounds against the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Aberrant activation of ERBB2 by gene amplification has been shown to participate in the pathophysiology of breast, ovarian, gastric, colorectal, lung, brain, and head and neck tumors. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled efficient identification of activating molecular alterations of ERBB2.

Unfortunately, antibody variable heavy and light domains (V(H) and V(L)) that mediate the interaction with antigen have the propensity to aggregate. Increasing their aggregation resistance in a general manner has proven to be a difficult and persistent problem, due to the high level of sequence diversity observed in human variable domains and the requirement to maintain antigen binding. Here we outline such an approach. By using phage display we identified specific positions that clustered in the antigen binding site (28, 30-33, 35 in V(H) and 24, 49-53, 56 in V(L)). Introduction of aspartate or glutamate at these positions endowed superior biophysical properties (non-aggregating, well-expressed, and heat-refoldable) onto domains derived from common human germline families (V(H)3 and V(\u03ba)1). The effects of the mutations were highly positional and independent of sequence diversity at other positions. Moreover, crystal structures of mutant V(H) and V(L) domains revealed a surprising degree of structural conservation, indicating compatibility with V(H)\/V(L) pairing and antigen binding. This allowed the retrofitting of existing binders, as highlighted by the development of robust high affinity antibody fragments derived from the breast cancer therapeutic Herceptin.

Targeting dysregulated signaling of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors (Erbb family) has encompassed over the last decade an ever increasing role in personalized treatment approaches in an increasing number of human malignancies. Erbbs are receptor tyrosine kinases that are important regulators of several signaling pathways. Two of its family members (Erbb1\/EGFR and Erbb2\/HER2) have previously been shown to be somatically mutated in large fraction of human cancers. To determine if this family is somatically mutated in melanoma, its sequences were recently analyzed and one of its members, Erbb4, was found to be somatically mutated in 19% of melanoma cases. Functional analysis of seven of its mutations was shown to increase its catalytic and transformation abilities as well as providing essential survival signals. Similar to other Erbb family members, mutant Erbb4 seems to confer 'oncogene addiction' on melanoma cells, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Gaining further understanding into the oncogenic mechanism of Erbb4 may not only help in the development of targeted therapy in melanoma patients but might accelerate the acceptance of a novel taxonomy of cancer which is based on the genomic perturbations in cancer genes and cancer gene families and their response to targeted agents.","author":"Rudloff U","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20404484","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"20022944":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cations, Divalent, Cell Line, Cell-Free System, Enzyme Activation, Humans, Liposomes, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Nickel, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Quaternary, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor, Receptor, erbB-2, Receptor, erbB-3, Sequence Alignment","date_submitted":"2010 Mar 5","title":"Her4 and Her2\/neu tyrosine kinase domains dimerize and activate in a reconstituted in vitro system.","abstract":"Her4 (ErbB-4) and Her2\/neu (ErbB-2) are receptor-tyrosine kinases belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family.

In silico modeling and high throughput mutagenesis were utilized to identify receptor mutants with very high ligand binding activity. A single mutation (T15S; EGFR subdomain I) enhanced affinity for EGF (two-fold), TGF-alpha (twenty-six-fold), and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF (six-fold). This indicates that T15 is an important, previously undescribed, negative regulatory amino acid for EGFR ligand binding.

Optimization required reversing this suppression by mutation of the EGFR tether domain (G564A; subdomain IV). This mutation resulted in enhanced ligand binding (EGF, ten-fold; TGF-alpha, thirty-four-fold; HB-EGF, seventeen-fold; NRG1-beta, thirty-one-fold).

In these HER2-overexpressing GLM series, protein kinase B (Akt), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1\/2 (ERK1\/2), was constitutively phosphorylated, and gefitinib efficiently inhibited this Akt phosphorylation, induced strong apoptosis in vitro and exhibited antitumour activity in tumour xenografts in nude mice.

In this work, we describe the pathophysiological and pharmacological relevance of the gating process in voltage-gated K(+) channels encoded by the K(v)7 gene family. After reviewing the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and on the structural models of voltage-dependent gating in VGICs, we describe the physiological relevance of these channels, with particular emphasis on those formed by K(v)7.2-K(v)7.5 subunits having a well-established role in controlling neuronal excitability in humans. In fact, genetically determined alterations in K(v)7.2 and K(v)7.3 genes are responsible for benign familial neonatal convulsions, a rare seizure disorder affecting newborns, and the pharmacological activation of K(v)7.2\/3 channels can exert antiepileptic activity in humans. Both mutation-triggered channel dysfunction and drug-induced channel activation can occur by impeding or facilitating, respectively, channel sensitivity to membrane voltage and can affect overlapping molecular sites within the voltage-sensing domain of these channels. Thus, understanding the molecular steps involved in voltage-sensing in K(v)7 channels will allow to better define the pathogenesis of rare human epilepsy, and to design innovative pharmacological strategies for the treatment of epilepsies and, possibly, other human diseases characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability.","author":"Miceli F","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/fphar.2011.00002","matches":"mutation"},"21652722":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Calcium Channels, R-Type, Cation Transport Proteins, DNA, Recombinant, Humans, Leucine, Molecular Sequence Data, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Point Mutation","date_submitted":"2011 Aug 5","title":"Double mutant cycle analysis identified a critical leucine residue in the IIS4S5 linker for the activation of the Ca(V)2.3 calcium channel.","abstract":"Mutations in distal S6 were shown to significantly alter the stability of the open state of Ca(V)2.3 (Raybaud, A., Baspinar, E.

Previous mutagenesis data obtained on the Kv channel KCNQ1 highlighted the critical role of specific residues in both the S4-S5 linker (S4S5(L)) and S6 C terminus (S6(T)). From these data, we hypothesized that S4S5(L) behaves like a ligand specifically interacting with S6(T) and stabilizing the closed state. To test this hypothesis, we designed plasmid-encoded peptides corresponding to portions of S4S5(L) and S6(T) of the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 and evaluated their effects on the channel activity in the presence and absence of the ancillary subunit KCNE1. We showed that S4S5(L) peptides inhibit KCNQ1, in a reversible and state-dependent manner. S4S5(L) peptides also inhibited a voltage-independent KCNQ1 mutant. This inhibition was competitively prevented by a peptide mimicking S6(T), consistent with S4S5(L) binding to S6(T). Val(254) in S4S5(L) is known to contact Leu(353) in S6(T) when the channel is closed, and mutations of these residues alter the coupling between the two regions.

We hypothesize that high-affinity Zn(2+) binding occurs at the dimer interface between pairs of His residues from both monomers. Consistent with this idea, Zn(2+) effects were weaker in monomeric channels. Mutation of His(193) and His(140) in various combinations and in tandem dimers revealed that channel opening was slowed by Zn(2+) only when at least one His was present in each monomer, suggesting that in wild-type (WT) H(V)1, Zn(2+) binding between His of both monomers inhibits channel opening. In addition, monomeric channels opened exponentially, and dimeric channels opened sigmoidally. Monomeric channel gating had weaker temperature dependence than dimeric channels. Finally, monomeric channels opened 6.6 times faster than dimeric channels. Together, these observations suggest that in the proton channel dimer, the two monomers are closely apposed and interact during a cooperative gating process. Zn(2+) appears to slow opening by preventing movement of the monomers relative to each other that is prerequisite to opening. These data also suggest that the association of the monomers is tenuous and allows substantial freedom of movement. The data support the idea that native proton channels are dimeric.

For the channel protein, we used two types of C-terminus: E+ and Eo. E+ contains, and Eo lacks, the EGEE residue quartet located distal to the S6 helix. For both E+ and Eo, the following trend was observed: When S4 helices were restrained at the same position as in the x-ray structure (S4high), the S6 gate remained open for 12 ns. The results were similar when the S4 helices were pulled downward 7 A (S4low). However, S4middle (or S4low) facilitated the S6 gate-narrowing for the following mutated channels (shown in order of increasing effect): 1), E395W; 2), E395W-F401A-F402A; and 3), E395W-F401A-F402A-V478W. The amino acid numbering system is that used for the Shaker channel.

In general, whereas subunit-based behavior appears to be dominant and to permit heteromeric conformations of the pore domain, direct intersubunit coupling of S5 or S6 is weak. Therefore, the \"concerted transition\" of the pore domain that has been predicted based on electrophysiological analyses is likely to be mediated mainly by the dual effects of S4 and the S4-S5 linker; these segments of one subunit can interact with both S5 of the same subunit and that of the adjacent subunit.","author":"Nishizawa M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bpj.2009.02.074","matches":"mutation, mutate, x-ray, energy, kJ"},"19564427":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Binding Sites, Computer Simulation, Drosophila Proteins, Models, Chemical, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Potassium Channels, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Static Electricity","date_submitted":"2009 Jul","title":"A structural model for K2P potassium channels based on 23 pairs of interacting sites and continuum electrostatics.","abstract":"K(2P)\u00d8, the two-pore domain potassium background channel that determines cardiac rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster, and its homologues that establish excitable membrane activity in mammals are of unknown structure.

Our results suggest that the voltage sensor forms a state- and pH-dependent, metal-selective binding pocket that may be occupied by Cu2+ at physiologically relevant concentrations to inhibit activation of BK and other channels.","author":"Ma Z","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200809980","matches":"mutation"},"18276733":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Antibodies, Female, Mice, Models, Structural, Mutation, Neomycin, Oocytes, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate, Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying, Protein Conformation, Protein Subunits, Protein Synthesis Inhibitors, Xenopus laevis","date_submitted":"2008 Apr 1","title":"Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulation of strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 channels: multilevel positive cooperativity.","abstract":"Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are gated by the interaction of their cytoplasmic regions with membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)).

Various Kir2.1 channel constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and single channel or macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches. The wild-type (WT) channel rarely visited the subconductance levels under control conditions. However, upon reducing Kir2.1 channel interaction with PIP(2) by a variety of interventions, including PIP(2) antibodies, screening PIP(2) with neomycin, or mutating PIP(2) binding sites (e.g. K188Q), visitation to the sublevels was markedly increased before channels were converted to an unavailable mode in which they did not open. No channel activity was detected in channels with the double mutation K188A\/R189A, a mutant which exhibits extremely weak interaction with PIP(2). By linking subunits together in tandem dimers or tetramers containing mixtures of WT and K188A\/R189A subunits, we demonstrate that one functional PIP(2)-interacting WT subunit is sufficient to convert channels from the unavailable to the available mode with a high open probability dominated by the fully open state, with similar kinetics as tetrameric WT channels. Occasional openings to sublevels become progressively less frequent as the number of WT subunits increases. Quantitative analysis reveals that the interaction of PIP(2) with WT subunits exerts strong positive cooperativity in both converting the channels from the unavailable to the available mode, and in promoting the fully open state over sublevels. We conclude that the interaction of PIP(2) with only one Kir2.1 subunit is sufficient for the channel to become available and to open to its full conductance state. Interaction with additional subunits exerts positive cooperativity at multiple levels to further enhance channel availability and promote the fully open state.","author":"Xie LH","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1113\/jphysiol.2007.147868","matches":"mutation"},"18042709":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acids, Aromatic, Conserved Sequence, Fungal Proteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Structure-Activity Relationship, Transient Receptor Potential Channels, Yeasts","date_submitted":"2007 Dec 4","title":"Yeast gain-of-function mutations reveal structure-function relationships conserved among different subfamilies of transient receptor potential channels.","abstract":"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels found in animals, protists, and fungi are primary chemo-, thermo-, or mechanosensors.

This locus however does not explain either the choice of Ca(2+) among other divalent cations or the specific conductances encountered in the different VGCC.

The translocation of the charge-carrying S4 transduces membrane voltage to gating conformational changes of the channel, but how it is positioned and moved with respect to membrane lipid remains controversial. We found that hydrophilic and especially arginine and lysine substitution for L361 at the external end of S4 causes a large negative shift with shallowed slope of both activation and inactivation curves in Shaker K+ channels. Also, the macroscopic kinetics of activation and inactivation become much faster and barely voltage dependent, especially in the L361R mutant channel. These steady-state and kinetic data suggest that the replacement of one single hydrophobic residue, leucine, with arginine may profoundly destabilize the resting conformation of S4, which therefore takes a partially extruded position (partly activated position) at resting potentials (e.g. -120 mV). Consistently, the L361R point mutation gives rise to an extracellularly exposed R365C that is readily modified by external hydrophilic sulfhydryl-specific agents in the resting channel. Moreover, the extruded S4 in the L361R mutant channel could be retracted by strong hyperpolarizing potentials ( approximately -180 mV), from which the mutant channel is gated with slower kinetics but evidently stronger voltage dependence.

Although conserved glycines at G148 and G157 made it significantly easier to open the channel, they were not an absolute requirement for pH gating in Kir1.1. In addition, none of the glycine mutants produced more than small changes in either the cell-attached or excised single-channel kinetics which, in this channel, argues against changes in the selectivity filter. The putative pH sensor at K61-Kir1.1b, (equivalent to K80-Kir1.1a) was also examined. Mutation of this lysine to an untitratable methionine did not abolish pH gating, but shifted the pKa into an acid range from 6.6 +\/- 0.01 to 5.4 +\/- 0.04, similar to pH gating in Kir2.1. Hence K61-Kir1.1b cannot function as the exclusive pH sensor for the channel, although it may act as one of multiple pH sensors, or as a link between a cytoplasmic sensor and the channel gate. K61-Kir1.1b also interacted differently with the two glycine mutations. Gating of the double mutant: K61M+G148A was indistinguishable from K61M alone, whereas gating of K61M+G157A was midway between the alkaline pKa of G157A and the acid pKa of K61M. Finally, closure of ROMK, G148A, G157A, and K61M all required the same L160-Kir1.1b residue at the cytoplasmic end of the inner transmembrane helix. Hence in wild-type and mutant channels, closure occurs by steric occlusion of the permeation path by four leucine side chains (L160-Kir1.1b) at the helix bundle crossing. This is facilitated by the conserved glycines on TM2, but pH gating in Kir1.1 does not absolutely require glycine hinges in this region.","author":"Sackin H","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1529\/biophysj.105.076653","matches":"mutation, mutate, alanine"},"16505150":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acids, Animals, Calcium, Cells, Cultured, Computer Simulation, Ion Channel Gating, Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels, Membrane Potentials, Models, Biological, Oocytes, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Sodium, Static Electricity, Structure-Activity Relationship, Xenopus laevis","date_submitted":"2006 Mar","title":"Role of charged residues in the S1-S4 voltage sensor of BK channels.","abstract":"The activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated (BK) potassium channels is weakly voltage dependent compared to Shaker and other voltage-gated K(+) (K(V)) channels.

The voltage dependence of P(O) and tau(I(K)) at extreme negative potentials was also reduced, implying that the closed-open conformational change and voltage sensor activation share a common source of gating charge. Although the position of charged residues in the BK and K(V) channel sequence appears conserved, the distribution of voltage-sensing residues is not. Thus the weak voltage dependence of BK channel activation does not merely reflect a lack of charge but likely differences with respect to K(V) channels in the position and movement of charged residues within the electric field. Although mutation of most sites in S1-S4 did not reduce gating charge, they often altered the equilibrium constant for voltage sensor activation. <b>In particular, neutralization of R207 or R210 in S4 stabilizes the activated state by 3-7 kcal mol(-1), indicating a strong contribution of non-voltage-sensing residues to channel function, consistent with their participation in state-dependent salt bridge interactions<\/b>.

The sodium channel was modelled in an open conformation with the insecticide-binding site located in a hydrophobic cavity delimited by the domain II S4-S5 linker and the IIS5 and IIIS6 helices. The binding cavity is predicted to be accessible to the lipid bilayer and therefore to lipid-soluble insecticides. The binding of insecticides and the consequent formation of binding contacts across different channel elements could stabilize the channel when in an open state, which is consistent with the prolonged sodium tail currents induced by pyrethroids and DDT. In the closed state, the predicted alternative positioning of the domain II S4-S5 linker would result in disruption of pyrethroid-binding contacts, consistent with the observation that pyrethroids have their highest affinity for the open channel. The model also predicts a key role for the IIS5 and IIIS6 helices in insecticide binding. Some of the residues on the helices that form the putative binding contacts are not conserved between arthropod and non-arthropod species, which is consistent with their contribution to insecticide species selectivity.

Significantly, the Kv3.4 subunit has been implicated in the major CNS disorders Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and it is claimed that selectively targeting this subunit will have therapeutic utility. Previous work suggested that BDS toxins (\"blood depressing substance,\" from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata) were specific blockers for rapidly inactivating Kv3.4 channels, and consequently these toxins are increasingly used as diagnostic agents for Kv3.4 subunits in central neurons. However, precisely how selective are these toxins for this important CNS protein? We show that BDS is not selective for Kv3.4 but markedly inhibits current through Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 channels. Inhibition comes about not by \"pore block\" but by striking modification of Kv3 gating kinetics and voltage dependence. Activation and inactivation kinetics are slowed by BDS-I and BDS-II, and V(1\/2) for activation is shifted to more positive voltages. Alanine substitution mutagenesis around the S3b and S4 segments of Kv3.2 reveals that BDS acts via voltage-sensing domains, and, consistent with this, ON gating currents from nonconducting Kv3.2 are markedly inhibited. The altered kinetics and gating properties, combined with lack of subunit selectivity with Kv3 subunits, seriously affects the usefulness of BDS toxins in CNS studies. Furthermore, our results do not easily fit with the voltage sensor \"paddle\" structure proposed recently for Kv channels.

Here we investigated the architecture of the inner pore of P\/Q-type Ca2+ channels using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method. Many positions in the S6 segments of all four repeats of the alpha1 subunit (Ca(v)2.1) were modified by internal methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET). However, the pattern of modification does not fit any known sequence alignment with K+ channels. In IIS6, five consecutive positions showed clear modification, suggesting a likely aqueous crevice and a loose packing between S6 and S5 segments, a notion further supported by the observation that some S5 positions were also accessible to internal MTSET. These results indicate that the inner pore of VGCCs is indeed formed by the S6 segments but is different from that of K+ channels. Interestingly some residues in IIIS6 and IVS6 whose mutations in L-type Ca2+ channels affect the binding of dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines and are thought to face the pore appeared not to react with internal MTSET.

The observation that the majority of nonconducting mutations are clustered toward the inner end of TM2 suggests a critical functional role for this region.","author":"Silberberg SD","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200409221","matches":"mutation"},"15623896":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Binding Sites, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, Kv1.5 Potassium Channel, Membrane Potentials, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated, Protein Binding, Protein Subunits, Recombinant Proteins, Structure-Activity Relationship","date_submitted":"2005 Jan","title":"Coupling of voltage sensing to channel opening reflects intrasubunit interactions in kv channels.","abstract":"Voltage-gated K(+) channels play a central role in the modulation of excitability. In these channels, the voltage-dependent movement of the voltage sensor (primarily S4) is coupled to the (S6) gate that opens the permeation pathway. Because of the tetrameric structure, such coupling could occur within each subunit or between adjacent subunits. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed various combinations of a S4 mutation (R401N) and a S6 mutation (P511G) in hKv1.5, incorporated into tandem constructs to constrain subunit stoichiometry. R401N shifted the voltage dependence of activation to negative potentials while P511G did the opposite. When both mutations were introduced in the same alpha-subunit of the tandem, the positive shift of P511G was compensated by the negative shift of R401N. With each mutation in a separate subunit of a tandem, this compensation did not occur. This suggests that for Kv channels, the coupling between voltage sensing and gating reflects primarily an intrasubunit interaction.","author":"Labro AJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200409194","matches":"mutation"},"15583130":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Bacillus, Cell Line, Cell Membrane, Cytoplasm, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, Leucine, Membrane Potentials, Mutation, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Proline, Sodium Channels","date_submitted":"2004 Dec 21","title":"Reversed voltage-dependent gating of a bacterial sodium channel with proline substitutions in the S6 transmembrane segment.","abstract":"Members of the voltage-gated-like ion channel superfamily have a conserved pore structure. Transmembrane helices that line the pore (M2 or S6) are thought to gate it at the cytoplasmic end by bending at a hinge glycine residue. Proline residues favor bending of alpha-helices, and substitution of proline for this glycine (G219) dramatically stabilizes the open state of a bacterial Na(+) channel NaChBac. Here we have probed S6 pore-lining residues of NaChBac by proline mutagenesis. Five of 15 proline-substitution mutants yielded depolarization-activated Na(+) channels, but only G219P channels have strongly negatively shifted voltage dependence of activation, demonstrating specificity for bending at G219 for depolarization-activated gating. Remarkably, three proline-substitution mutations on the same face of S6 as G219 yielded channels that activated upon hyperpolarization and inactivated very slowly. Studies of L226P showed that hyperpolarization to -147 mV gives half-maximal activation, 123 mV more negative than WT. Analysis of combination mutations and studies of block by the local anesthetic etidocaine favored the conclusion that hyperpolarization-activated gating results from opening of the cytoplasmic gate formed by S6 helices. Substitution of multiple amino acids for L226 indicated that hyperpolarization-activated gating was correlated with a high propensity for bending, whereas depolarization-activated gating was favored by a low propensity for bending. Our results further define the dominant role of bending of S6 in determining not only the voltage dependence but also the polarity of voltage-dependent gating. Native hyperpolarization-activated gating of hyperpolarization- and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in animals and KAT channels in plants may involve bending at analogous S6 amino acid residues.","author":"Zhao Y","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0408270101","matches":"mutation"},"15545400":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Animals, Cells, Cultured, Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, Membrane Potentials, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Oocytes, Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated, Recombinant Proteins, Static Electricity, Structure-Activity Relationship, Xenopus laevis","date_submitted":"2004 Dec","title":"Gating charges in the activation and inactivation processes of the HERG channel.","abstract":"The hERG channel has a relatively slow activation process but an extremely fast and voltage-sensitive inactivation process.

This study is designed to address three questions: (1) which of the six positive charges in hERG's major voltage sensor, S4, are responsible for gating charge transfer during activation, (2) whether a negative charge in the cytoplasmic half of S2 (D466) also contributes to gating charge transfer, and (3) whether S4 serves as the sole voltage sensor for hERG inactivation. We individually mutate S4's positive charges and D466 to cysteine, and examine (a) effects of mutations on the number of equivalent gating charges transferred during activation (z(a)) and inactivation (z(i)), and (b) sidedness and state dependence of accessibility of introduced cysteine side chains to a membrane-impermeable thiol-modifying reagent (MTSET). Neutralizing the outer three positive charges in S4 and D466 in S2 reduces z(a), and cysteine side chains introduced into these positions experience state-dependent changes in MTSET accessibility. On the other hand, neutralizing the inner three positive charges in S4 does not affect z(a). None of the charge mutations affect z(i). We propose that the scheme of gating charge transfer during hERG's activation process is similar to that described for the Shaker channel, although hERG has less gating charge in its S4 than in Shaker. Furthermore, channel domain other than S4 contributes to gating charge involved in hERG's inactivation process.","author":"Zhang M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200409119","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"15454416":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Binding Sites, Computer Simulation, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, Models, Biological, Models, Chemical, Models, Molecular, Potassium Channels, Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Shaker Superfamily of Potassium Channels, Structure-Activity Relationship","date_submitted":"2004 Oct","title":"Models of the structure and voltage-gating mechanism of the shaker K+ channel.","abstract":"In the preceding, accompanying article, we present models of the structure and voltage-dependent gating mechanism of the KvAP bacterial K+ channel that are based on three types of evidence: crystal structures of portions of the KvAP protein, theoretical modeling criteria for membrane proteins, and biophysical studies of the properties of native and mutated voltage-gated channels.

In the present study we explore the mechanism underlying the nonconducting phenotype in V478W and compare it to that of W434F, a mutation located in an extracellular region of the pore that is nonconducting because the channel is predominantly found in an inactivated state. We began by examining whether the intracellular gate moves using probes that interact with the intracellular pore and by studying the inactivation properties of heterodimeric channels that are competent to conduct ions. The results of these experiments support distinct mechanisms underlying nonconduction in W434F and V478W, suggesting that the gate in V478W either remains closed, or that the mutation has created a large barrier to ion permeation in the open state. Single channel recordings for heterodimeric and double mutant constructs in which ion conduction is rescued suggest that the V478W mutation does not dramatically alter unitary conductance. Taken together, our results suggest that the V478W mutation causes a profound shift of the closed to open equilibrium toward the closed state.

Abramson, and R. MacKinnon. 1992. Science. 258:1152-1155). Exchanging the aspartate residue with asparagine in this sequence abolishes ionic conductance of the Shaker K+ channel (D447N) (Hurst, R.S., L. Toro, and E. Stefani. 1996. FEBS Lett. 388:59-65). In contrast, we found that the corresponding mutation (D292N) in the pore forming alpha subunit (hSlo) of the voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel (BKCa, MaxiK) did not prevent conduction but reduced single channel conductance. We have investigated the role of outer pore negative charges in ion conduction (this paper) and channel gating (Haug, T., R. Olcese, T. Ligia, and E. Stefani. 2004. J. Gen Physiol. 124:185-197). In symmetrical 120 mM [K+], the D292N mutation reduced the outward single channel conductance by approximately 40% and nearly abolished inward K+ flow (outward rectification). This rectification was partially relieved by increasing the external K+ concentration to 700 mM. Small inward currents were resolved by introducing an additional mutation (R207Q) that greatly increases the open probability of the channel. A four-state multi-ion pore model that incorporates the effects of surface charge was used to simulate the essential properties of channel conduction. The conduction properties of the mutant channel (D292N) could be predicted by a simple approximately 8.5-fold reduction of the surface charge density without altering any other parameter. These results indicate that the aspartate residue in the BKCa pore plays a key role in conduction and suggest that the pore structure is not affected by the mutation. We speculate that the negative charge strongly accumulates K+ in the outer vestibule close to the selectivity filter, thus increasing the rate of ion entry into the pore.","author":"Haug T","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200308949","matches":"mutation"},"15196930":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Cell Line, Cysteine Endopeptidases, Humans, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multienzyme Complexes, Mutation, Potassium Channels, Precipitin Tests, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Protein Folding","date_submitted":"2004 Jun 18","title":"Voltage sensor mutations differentially target misfolded K+ channel subunits to proteasomal and non-proteasomal disposal pathways.","abstract":"In Shaker K(+) channels, formation of an electrostatic interaction between two charged residues, D316 and K374 in transmembrane segments S3 and S4, respectively, is a key step in voltage sensor biogenesis.

The fourth transmembrane domain (S4) of HERG, like other voltage-gated K(+) channels, contains multiple positive charges and is the voltage sensor for activation. In this study, we mutated each of the positively charged residues in this region to glutamine (Q), expressed the mutant and wild-type (WT) channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes and studied them using two-electrode voltage clamp methods. K525Q channels activated at more hyperpolarized potentials than WT, whereas all the other mutant channels activated at more depolarized potentials. All mutants except for R531Q also had a reduction in apparent gating charge associated with activation. Mutation of K525 to cysteine (C) resulted in a less dramatic phenotype than K525Q. The addition of the positively charged MTSET to K525C altered the phenotype to one more similar to K525Q than to WT. Therefore it is not charge per se, but the specific lysine side chain at position 525, that is crucial for stabilizing the closed state. When rates of activation and deactivation for WT and mutant channels were compared at equivalent total (chemical + electrostatic) driving forces, K525Q and R528Q accelerated activation but had no effect on deactivation, R531Q slowed activation and deactivation, R534Q accelerated activation but slowed deactivation and R537Q accelerated deactivation but had no effect on activation.

Previously, site-directed fluorescence measurements were shown to track S4 transitions in each of the four domains. Here, using a similar technique, we provide direct evidence of coupling interactions between voltage sensors in the sodium channel. Pairwise interactions between S4s were evaluated by comparing site-specific conformational changes in the presence and absence of a gating perturbation in a distal domain. Reciprocity of effect, a fundamental property of thermodynamically coupled systems, was measured by generating converse mutants. The magnitude of a local gating perturbation induced by a remote S4 mutation depends on the coupling strength and the relative equilibrium positions of the two voltage sensors. In general, our data indicates that the movement of all four voltage sensors in the sodium channel are coupled to a varying extent. Moreover, a gating perturbation in S4-DI has the largest effect on the activation of S4-DIV and vice versa, demonstrating an energetic linkage between S4-DI and S4-DIV.

This association leads to alteration of biophysical properties, including a slowing of activation, a suppression of inactivation and an increase of the apparent single-channel conductance. In addition, inward Rb+ currents conducted by homomeric KCNQ1 channels are about threefold larger than K+ currents, whereas heteromeric KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels have smaller inward Rb+ currents compared to K+ currents. We determined inactivation properties and compared K+ vs. Rb+ inward currents for channels formed by co-assembly of KCNQ1 with KCNE1, KCNE3 and KCNE5, and for homomeric KCNQ1 channels with point mutations in the pore helix S5 or S6 transmembrane domains. Several of the channels with point mutations eliminated the apparent inactivation of KCNQ1, as described previously (Seebohm et al. 2001). We found that the extent of inactivation and the ratio of Rb+\/K+ currents were positively correlated. Since the effect of Rb+ on the current size has been shown previously to be related to a fast 'flickery' process, our results suggest that inactivation of KCNQ1 channels is related to a fast flicker of the open channel. A kinetic model incorporating two open states, no explicit inactivated state and a fast flicker that is different for the two open states is able to account for the apparent inactivation and the correlation of inactivation and large Rb+ currents.

Rate-equilibrium free energy relationship analysis indicates that alphaD97 moves early in the gating reaction, in synchrony with the movement of the transmitter binding site (Phi = 0.93, which implies an open-like character at the transition state). alphaD97 mutations in the two alpha-subunits have unequal energetic consequences for gating, but their contributions are independent. We conclude that the key, underlying functional consequence of alphaD97 perturbations is to increase the unliganded gating equilibrium constant. L5 emerges as an important and early link in the AChR gating reaction which, in the absence of agonist, serves to increase the relative stability of the closed conformation of the protein.","author":"Chakrapani S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.200308885","matches":"mutation, energy, affinity"},"12925732":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Calcium, Ion Channel Gating, Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel alpha Subunits, Magnesium, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Potassium Channels, Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated, Protein Conformation, Structure-Activity Relationship","date_submitted":"2003 Sep 2","title":"Participation of the S4 voltage sensor in the Mg2+-dependent activation of large conductance (BK) K+ channels.","abstract":"The S4 transmembrane segment is the primary voltage sensor in voltage-dependent ion channels.

Panels of somatically mutated antibodies encoded by a common VH gene, but each binding to a different antigen, were computationally redesigned to predict antibodies that could engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state design process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing by computational design the residues that are predicted to enable polyspecificity, i.e., binding of many unrelated antigens with a common sequence. The process thereby reverses antibody maturation in silico. In contrast, when designing antibodies to bind a single antigen, a sequence similar to that of the mature antibody sequence was returned, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico. We demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody\/antigen recognition. While the hypervariable region CDR3 often mediates much of the specificity of mature antibodies, we identified key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework that are critical contributors for polyspecificity in germline antibodies.

The toxin, Doc, mediates cooperative interactions between adjacent Phd-binding sites and thereby enhances repression. Here, we describe a homologous operon from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium which has the same pattern of regulation but an altered repressor-operator specificity. This difference in specificity maps to the seventh amino acid of the repressor and to the symmetric first and eighth positions of the corresponding palindromic repressor-binding sites. Thus, the repressor-operator interface has coevolved so as to retain the interaction while altering the specificity. Within an alignment of homologous repressors, the seventh amino acid of the repressor is highly variable, indicating that evolutionary changes in repressor specificity may be common in this protein family. We suggest that the robust properties of the negative feedback loop, the fuzzy recognition in the operator-repressor interface, and the duplication and divergence of the repressor-binding sites have facilitated the speciation of this repressor-operator interface.

Therefore, in the present work, we have explored the extent to which protein interaction surfaces and aggregation-prone regions overlap in globular proteins associated with conformational diseases. Computational analysis of the native complexes formed by these proteins shows that aggregation-prone regions do frequently overlap with protein interfaces. The spatial coincidence of interaction sites and aggregating regions suggests that the formation of functional complexes and the aggregation of their individual subunits might compete in the cell. Accordingly, single mutations affecting complex interface or stability usually result in the formation of toxic aggregates. It is suggested that the stabilization of existing interfaces in multimeric proteins or the formation of new complexes in monomeric polypeptides might become effective strategies to prevent disease-linked aggregation of globular proteins.","author":"Castillo V","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1000476","matches":"mutation"},"17389393":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Cluster Analysis, Computer Simulation, Crystallization, Enzyme Stability, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, Muramidase, Point Mutation, Pressure, Protein Denaturation, Protein Folding, Protein Structure, Secondary, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Static Electricity, Temperature, Tryptophan, Urea, Water","date_submitted":"2007 Apr 3","title":"Destruction of long-range interactions by a single mutation in lysozyme.","abstract":"We propose a mechanism, based on a > or =10-micros molecular dynamics simulation, for the surprising misfolding of hen egg-white lysozyme caused by a single mutation (W62G). Our simulations of the wild-type and mutant lysozymes in 8 M urea solution at biological temperature (with both pH 2 and 7) reveal that the mutant structure is much less stable than that of the wild type, with the mutant showing larger fluctuations and less native-like contacts. Analysis of local contacts reveals that the Trp-62 residue is the key to a cooperative long-range interaction within the wild type, where it acts like a bridge between two neighboring basic residues. Thus, a native-like cluster or nucleation site can form near these residues in the wild type but not in the mutant. The time evolution of the secondary structure also exhibits a quicker loss of the beta-sheets in the mutant than in the wild type, whereas some of the alpha-helices persist during the entire simulation in both the wild type and the mutant in 8 M urea (even though the tertiary structures are basically all gone).

Our structural studies reveal that the epitope includes neither the site of mutation nor most residues in the region of the protein structure that is destabilized by the mutation. Instead, the binding of the antibody fragment achieves its effect by restoring the structural cooperativity characteristic of the wild-type protein. This appears to occur at least in part through the transmission of long-range conformational effects to the interface between the two structural domains of the protein.

A non-germ line-encoded proline in the elbow between V(H) and C(H)1 and an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions in the V(H)\/V(H)' interface have been proposed to be crucial for domain exchange.

Substitution of 5 to 7 residues for those of the wild type produced a significant fraction of domain-exchanged molecules, with no evidence of equilibrium between domain-exchanged and conventional forms.

Almost completely unknown is the degree to which stability of different regions of a protein is generally preserved throughout evolution. In this work, these questions are addressed through thermodynamic analysis of a large representative sample of protein fold space based on remote, yet accepted, homology. More than 3,000 proteins were computationally analyzed using the structural-thermodynamic algorithm COREX\/BEST. Estimated position-specific stability (i.e., local Gibbs free energy of folding) and its component enthalpy and entropy were quantitatively compared between all proteins in the sample according to all-vs.-all pairwise structural alignment. It was discovered that the local stabilities of homologous pairs were significantly more correlated than those of non-homologous pairs, indicating that local stability was indeed generally conserved throughout evolution. However, the position-specific enthalpy and entropy underlying stability were less correlated, suggesting that the overall regional stability of a protein was more important than the thermodynamic mechanism utilized to achieve that stability. Finally, two different types of statistically exceptional evolutionary structure-thermodynamic relationships were noted. First, many homologous proteins contained regions of similar thermodynamics despite localized structure change, suggesting a thermodynamic mechanism enabling evolutionary fold change. Second, some homologous proteins with extremely similar structures nonetheless exhibited different local stabilities, a phenomenon previously observed experimentally in this laboratory. These two observations, in conjunction with the principal conclusion that homologous proteins generally conserved local stability, may provide guidance for a future thermodynamically informed classification of protein homology.","author":"Wrabl JO","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1000722","matches":"mutation, energy"}},"15099749":{"19633428":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Alternative Splicing, Electrophysiology, Erythromelalgia, Exons, Humans, Mutation, NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel, Phenotype, Sodium Channels, Somatoform Disorders","date_submitted":"2009 Jul-Aug","title":"Alternative splicing of Na(V)1.7 exon 5 increases the impact of the painful PEPD mutant channel I1461T.","abstract":"Alternative splicing is known to alter pharmacological sensitivities, kinetics, channel distribution under pathological conditions, and developmental regulation of VGSCs.

We compared the effects alternative splicing has on the biophysical properties of Na(V)1.7 wild-type, IEM (I136V) and PEPD (I1461T) channels. Our major findings demonstrate that although the 5A splice variant of the IEM channel had no functional impact, the 5A splice variant of the PEPD channel significantly hyperpolarized the activation curve, slowed deactivation and closed-state inactivation, shifted the ramp current activation to more hyperpolarized potentials, and increased ramp current amplitude.

This improved affinity will be valuable when exploring the role of MT-SP1 in mouse models of cancer, and the strategy outlined here could be useful in fine-tuning antibody specificity.","author":"Farady CJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bmcl.2009.05.005","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"18602117":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acids, Calorimetry, Carrier Proteins, Crystallography, X-Ray, Fibronectins, Kinetics, Maltose-Binding Proteins, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Secondary, Serine, Thermodynamics, Tyrosine","date_submitted":"2008 Aug 29","title":"A dominant conformational role for amino acid diversity in minimalist protein-protein interfaces.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that highly simplified interaction surfaces consisting of combinations of just two amino acids, Tyr and Ser, exhibit high affinity and specificity. The high functional levels of such minimalist interfaces might thus indicate small contributions of greater amino acid diversity seen in natural interfaces. Toward addressing this issue, we have produced a pair of binding proteins built on the fibronectin type III scaffold, termed \"monobodies.\" One monobody contains the Tyr\/Ser binary-code interface (termed YS) and the other contains an expanded amino acid diversity interface (YSX), but both bind to an identical target, maltose-binding protein. The YSX monobody bound with higher affinity, a slower off rate and a more favorable enthalpic contribution than the YS monobody. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures revealed that both proteins bound to an essentially identical epitope, providing a unique opportunity to directly investigate the role of amino acid diversity in a protein interaction interface. Surprisingly, Tyr still dominates the YSX paratope and the additional amino acid types are primarily used to conformationally optimize contacts made by tyrosines. Scanning mutagenesis showed that while all contacting Tyr side chains are essential in the YS monobody, the YSX interface was more tolerant to mutations. These results suggest that the conformational, not chemical, diversity of additional types of amino acids provided higher functionality and evolutionary robustness, supporting the dominant role of Tyr and the importance of conformational diversity in forming protein interaction interfaces.","author":"Gilbreth RN","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2008.06.014","matches":"mutation, x-ray, crystallography, affinity"},"18393447":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acids, Aromatic, Carbon Isotopes, Hydrogen, Kinetics, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Models, Molecular, Movement, Mutant Proteins, Mutation, Protein Conformation, Proteins, Thermodynamics, Time Factors","date_submitted":"2008 Apr 29","title":"Monitoring aromatic picosecond to nanosecond dynamics in proteins via 13C relaxation: expanding perturbation mapping of the rigidifying core mutation, V54A, in eglin c.","abstract":"Long-range effects, such as allostery, have evolved in proteins as a means of regulating function via communication between distal sites.

Current DNA based methodologies generally suffer from nucleotide substitution bias that preferentially mutate particular base pairs or show significant bias with respect to transitions or transversions. In this report, we describe a novel RNA-based random mutagenesis strategy that utilizes Qbeta replicase to manufacture complex mRNA libraries with a mutational spectrum that is close to the ideal.\n\nWe show that Qbeta replicase generates all possible base substitutions with an equivalent preference for mutating A\/T or G\/C bases and with no significant bias for transitions over transversions. To demonstrate the high diversity that can be sampled from a Qbeta replicase-generated mRNA library, the approach was used to evolve the binding affinity of a single domain VNAR shark antibody fragment (12Y-2) against malarial apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) via ribosome display. <b>The binding constant (KD) of 12Y-2 was increased by 22-fold following two consecutive but discrete rounds of mutagenesis and selection<\/b>.

The dyad plays remarkably different roles in their catalytic processes that usually involve metal coordination. An HD motif is positioned directly on the amyloid beta fragment (A\u03b2) and on the carboxy-terminal region of the extracellular domain (CAED) of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and a taxonomically well defined group of APP orthologues (APPOs). In human A\u03b2 HD is part of a presumed, RGD-like integrin-binding motif RHD; however, neither RHD nor RXD demonstrates reasonable conservation in APPOs. The sequences of CAEDs and the position of the HD are not particularly conserved either, yet we show with a novel statistical method using evolutionary modeling that the presence of HD on CAEDs cannot be the result of neutral evolutionary forces (p<0.0001). The motif is positively selected along the evolutionary process in the majority of APPOs, despite the fact that HD motif is underrepresented in the proteomes of all species of the animal kingdom. Position migration can be explained by high probability occurrence of multiple copies of HD on intermediate sequences, from which only one is kept by selective evolutionary forces, in a similar way as in the case of the \"transcription binding site turnover.\" CAED of all APP orthologues and homologues are predicted to bind metal ions including Amyloid-like protein 1 (APLP1) and Amyloid-like protein 2 (APLP2). Our results suggest that HDs on the CAEDs are most probably key components of metal-binding domains, which facilitate and\/or regulate inter- or intra-molecular interactions in a metal ion-dependent or metal ion concentration-dependent manner. The involvement of naturally occurring mutations of HD (Tottori (D7N) and English (H6R) mutations) in early onset Alzheimer's disease gives additional support to our finding that HD has an evolutionary preserved function on APPOs.","author":"Mikl\u00f3s I","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002356","matches":"mutation"},"22308022":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cell Line, Cricetinae, Disulfides, Epidermal Growth Factor, Humans, Integrin alphaVbeta3, Molecular Sequence Data, Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary","date_submitted":"2012 Mar 16","title":"Unique disulfide bonds in epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains of \u03b23 affect structure and function of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins in different manner.","abstract":"The \u03b23 subunit of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins contains four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains.

We determined here that ANDV infection of human endothelial cells or Syrian hamster-derived BHK-21 cells was selectively inhibited by the high-affinity alpha(v)beta(3) integrin ligand vitronectin and by antibodies to alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Further, antibodies to the beta(3) integrin PSI domain, as well as PSI domain polypeptides derived from human and Syrian hamster beta(3) subunits, but not murine or bovine beta(3), inhibited ANDV infection of both BHK-21 and human endothelial cells. These findings suggest that ANDV interacts with beta(3) subunits through PSI domain residues conserved in both Syrian hamster and human beta(3) integrins. Sequencing the Syrian hamster beta(3) integrin PSI domain revealed eight differences between Syrian hamster and human beta(3) integrins. Analysis of residues within the PSI domains of human, Syrian hamster, murine, and bovine beta(3) integrins identified unique proline substitutions at residues 32 and 33 of murine and bovine PSI domains that could determine ANDV recognition. Mutagenizing the human beta(3) PSI domain to contain the L33P substitution present in bovine beta(3) integrin abolished the ability of the PSI domain to inhibit ANDV infectivity. Conversely, mutagenizing either the bovine PSI domain, P33L, or the murine PSI domain, S32P, to the residue present human beta(3) permitted PSI mutants to inhibit ANDV infection. Similarly, CHO cells transfected with the full-length bovine beta(3) integrin containing the P33L mutation permitted infection by ANDV. These findings indicate that human and Syrian hamster alpha(v)beta(3) integrins are key receptors for ANDV and that specific residues within the beta(3) integrin PSI domain are required for ANDV infection. Since L33P is a naturally occurring human beta(3) polymorphism, these findings further suggest the importance of specific beta(3) integrin residues in hantavirus infection.

Eight single-point mutants were designed at these sites, of which five bound ligands much better than wild type. Further, these mutants were found to be in a more extended conformation than wild type, suggesting that the conformational change at the ligand binding headpiece was propagated to the legs of the integrin. This detailed understanding of the conformational change will assist in the development of allosteric drugs that either stabilize or destabilize specific integrin conformations without occluding the ligand-binding site.","author":"Luo BH","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M806312200","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"18987357":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Adenosine Diphosphate, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cell Line, Conserved Sequence, Cricetinae, Fibrinogen, Humans, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptides, Platelet Aggregation, Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex, Protein Binding, Rats, Recombinant Proteins, Sequence Alignment, Tyrosine","date_submitted":"2009 Jan 22","title":"Species differences in small molecule binding to alpha IIb beta 3 are the result of sequence differences in 2 loops of the alpha IIb beta propeller.","abstract":"Compared with human platelets, rodent platelets are less responsive to peptides and peptidomimetics containing an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif. Using chimeric human-rat alphaIIbbeta3 molecules, we found that this difference in Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sensitivity was the result of amino acid substitutions at residues 157, 159, and 162 in the W3:4-1 loop and an Asp-His replacement at residue 232 in the W4:4-1 loop of the alphaIIb beta propeller. Introducing the entire rat W3:4-1 and W4:4-1 loops into human alphaIIbbeta3 also decreased the inhibitory effect of the disintegrins, echistatin and eristostatin, and the alphaIIbbeta3 antagonists, tirofiban and eptifibatide, on fibrinogen binding, whereas the specific point mutations did not. This suggests that RGDS interacts with alphaIIb in a different manner than with these small molecules. None of these species-based substitutions affected the ability of alphaIIbbeta3 to interact with RGD-containing macromolecules. Thus, human von Willebrand factor contains an RGD motif and binds equally well to adenosine diphosphate-stimulated human and rodent platelets, implying that other motifs are responsible for maintaining ligand binding affinity. Many venoms contain RGD-based toxins. Our data suggest that these species amino acids differences in the alphaIIb beta-propeller represent an evolutionary response by rodents to maintain hemostasis while concurrently protecting against RGD-containing toxins.","author":"Basani RB","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2008-09-177337","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"18840725":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Fibrinogen, Hematology, History, 20th Century, History, 21st Century, Humans, Medical Laboratory Science, Platelet Aggregation, Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors, Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex, Thrombasthenia","date_submitted":"2008 Oct 15","title":"The GPIIb\/IIIa (integrin alphaIIbbeta3) odyssey: a technology-driven saga of a receptor with twists, turns, and even a bend.","abstract":"Starting 90 years ago with a clinical description by Glanzmann of a bleeding disorder associated with a defect in platelet function, technologic advances helped investigators identify the defect as a mutation(s) in the integrin family receptor, alphaIIbbeta3, which has the capacity to bind fibrinogen (and other ligands) and support platelet-platelet interactions (aggregation). The receptor's activation state was found to be under exquisite control, with activators, inhibitors, and elaborate inside-out signaling mechanisms controlling its conformation. Structural biology has produced high-resolution images defining the ligand binding site at the atomic level. Research on alphaIIbbeta3 has been bidirectional, with basic insights resulting in improved Glanzmann thrombasthenia carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis, assays to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, and the development of alphaIIbbeta3 antagonists, the first rationally designed antiplatelet agents, to prevent and treat thrombotic cardiovascular disease. The future looks equally bright, with the potential for improved drugs and the application of gene therapy and stem cell biology to address the genetic abnormalities.

In collagen-binding integrins, such as alpha2beta1, ligand recognition takes place exclusively at the alpha subunit I domain. However, activation of the alphaI domain depends on its interaction with a structurally similar domain in the beta subunit known as the I-like or betaI domain. The top face of the betaI domain contains three cation-binding sites: the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), the ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS), and LIMBS (ligand-associated metal-binding site). The role of these sites in controlling ligand binding to the alphaI domain has yet to be elucidated. Mutation of the MIDAS or LIMBS completely blocked collagen binding to alpha2beta1; in contrast mutation of the ADMIDAS reduced ligand recognition but this effect could be overcome by the activating monoclonal antibody TS2\/16. Hence, the MIDAS and LIMBS appear to be essential for the interaction between alphaI and betaI, whereas occupancy of the ADMIDAS has an allosteric effect on the conformation of betaI. An activating mutation in the alpha2 I domain partially restored ligand binding to the MIDAS and LIMBS mutants. Analysis of the effects of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Mn(2+) on ligand binding to these mutants showed that the MIDAS is a ligand-competent site through which Mn(2+) stimulates ligand binding, whereas the LIMBS is a stimulatory Ca(2+)-binding site, occupancy of which increases the affinity of Mg(2+) for the MIDAS.","author":"Valdramidou D","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M802066200","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"18209068":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acid Substitution, Antigens, CD11a, Antigens, CD18, Arginine, Cell Line, Cell Membrane, Dimerization, Humans, Integrin beta3, Lysine, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Protein Conformation, Protein Subunits","date_submitted":"2008 Feb 1","title":"Role of the beta-subunit arginine\/lysine finger in integrin heterodimer formation and function.","abstract":"Formation of the integrin alphabeta heterodimer is essential for cell surface expression and function.

Mutation of two inward-pointing Leu residues in edge beta-strand E to Lys increased monomer stability, confirming the hypothesis that inward-pointing charged side chains on edge beta-strands are an important design feature to prevent beta-supersheet formation.

Thus, although talin recruitment requires alphaPS2betaPS, talin levels are not simply specified by the amount of integrin at the adhesive junction.

For proteins in the calnexin cycle, removal of the terminal mannose residue of the middle branch of the core N-linked glycan results in degradation. Inhibition of the enzyme that removes this mannose residue prevented pro-alphaIIb degradation in beta3-null murine megakaryocytes. alphaIIb contains a conserved glycosylation consensus sequence at N15, and an N15Q mutation prevented pro-alphaIIb maturation, complex formation, and degradation. Our findings suggest that pro-alphaIIb engages the calnexin cycle via the N15 glycan and that failure of pro-alphaIIb to complex normally with beta3 results in proteasomal degradation.","author":"Mitchell WB","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2005-07-2990","matches":"mutation"},"16247034":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Actins, Animals, Cell Adhesion, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Movement, Cricetinae, Gene Expression Regulation, Integrin alphaVbeta3, Ligands, Manganese, Mice, Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate","date_submitted":"2005 Oct 24","title":"The mechanisms and dynamics of (alpha)v(beta)3 integrin clustering in living cells.","abstract":"During cell migration, the physical link between the extracellular substrate and the actin cytoskeleton mediated by receptors of the integrin family is constantly modified.

The mutant alpha(IIb) W967C forms disulfide-linked alpha(IIb)-subunits within an (alpha(IIb)beta(3))(2) tetramer. This tetramer behaved as an ideal model for the valency mode of regulation, because it exhibited significantly increased binding to multivalent but not monovalent ligands and basally retained the bent conformation. By contrast, the activating Leu mutants showed increased binding to the monovalent, ligand-mimetic PAC-1 Fab and increased exposure of ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes, suggesting that they partially adopt an extended conformation. Furthermore, the previously described beta(3)G708N mutation in Chinese hamster ovary cells enhanced ligand binding affinity, not valency, and did not alter cell-surface clustering as defined by confocal microscopy.

Saturation mutagenesis of surface-exposed CD3\u03b5 residues, coupled with assays of antibody-induced signaling by the mutated complexes, suggests a new configuration for the complex within which CD3\u03b5 is highly exposed and reveals that no large new CD3\u03b5 interfaces are required to form during antibody-induced signaling.

Therefore, we propose that erlotinib and, especially, cetuximab treatment may be a promising therapeutic strategy in GBM patients harboring EGFR CTD deletion mutants.","author":"Cho J","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-11-0821","matches":"mutation"},"21687663":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antineoplastic Agents, Aptamers, Nucleotide, Base Sequence, Biological Transport, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Epidermal Growth Factor, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Phosphorylation, Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor, Substrate Specificity, Thymidine","date_submitted":"2011","title":"Inhibition of cell proliferation by an anti-EGFR aptamer.","abstract":"Aptamers continue to receive interest as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases, including cancer.

However, the mechanism for this activity was unclear. Crystallographic structures for Fab:EGFR(287-302) complexes of mAb806 (and a second, related antibody, mAb175) show that this peptide epitope adopts conformations similar to those found in the wtEGFR. However, in both conformations observed for wtEGFR, tethered and untethered, antibody binding would be prohibited by significant steric clashes with the CR1 domain. Thus, these antibodies must recognize a cryptic epitope in EGFR. Structurally, it appeared that breaking the disulfide bond preceding the epitope might allow the CR1 domain to open up sufficiently for antibody binding. The EGFR(C271A\/C283A) mutant not only binds mAb806, but binds with 1:1 stoichiometry, which is significantly greater than wtEGFR binding. Although mAb806 and mAb175 decrease tumor growth in xenografts displaying mutant, overexpressed, or autocrine stimulated EGFR, neither antibody inhibits the in vitro growth of cells expressing wtEGFR. In contrast, mAb806 completely inhibits the ligand-associated stimulation of cells expressing EGFR(C271A\/C283A). Clearly, the binding of mAb806 and mAb175 to the wtEGFR requires the epitope to be exposed either during receptor activation, mutation, or overexpression.

To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations.

HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.","author":"Chen W","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2011.12.089","matches":"mutation, mutate, affinity"},"21909262":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antibodies, Neutralizing, B-Lymphocytes, Epitopes, Glycosylation, HIV Envelope Protein gp41, HIV-1, Humans, Macaca mulatta, Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase, env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2011 Sep","title":"Envelope deglycosylation enhances antigenicity of HIV-1 gp41 epitopes for both broad neutralizing antibodies and their unmutated ancestor antibodies.","abstract":"The HIV-1 gp41 envelope (Env) membrane proximal external region (MPER) is an important vaccine target that in rare subjects can elicit neutralizing antibodies.

We have studied the effect of partial deglycosylation under non-denaturing (native) conditions on gp140 Env antigenicity for MPER neutralizing antibodies and their reverted unmutated ancestor antibodies. We found that native deglycosylation of clade B JRFL gp140 as well as group M consensus gp140 Env CON-S selectively increased the reactivity of Env with the broad neutralizing human mAbs, 2F5 and 4E10. Whereas fully glycosylated gp140 Env either did not bind (JRFL), or weakly bound (CON-S), 2F5 and 4E10 reverted unmutated ancestors, natively deglycosylated JRFL and CON-S gp140 Envs did bind well to these putative mimics of naive B cell receptors.

In this regard, immunization of rhesus macaques demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity of the 2F5 MPER epitope on deglyosylated JRFL gp140 compared to glycosylated JRFL gp140. Thus, the lack of 2F5 and 4E10 reverted unmutated ancestor binding to gp140 Env may not always be due to lack of unmutated ancestor antibody reactivity with gp41 peptide epitopes, but rather, may be due to glycan interference of binding of unmutated ancestor antibodies of broad neutralizing mAb to Env gp41.","author":"Ma BJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002200","matches":"mutate"},"21835785":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Substitution, CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Cells, Cultured, Gene Expression, HIV-1, Humans, Macrophages, Receptors, Formyl Peptide, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled, Receptors, HIV, Receptors, Lipoxin, Receptors, Peptide, Viral Tropism, env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2011 Oct","title":"Primary infection by a human immunodeficiency virus with atypical coreceptor tropism.","abstract":"The great majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains enter CD4+ target cells by interacting with one of two coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4.

Nine dominant mutations appeared in five gp120 epitopes within the first year of infection, whereas all four mutations found in two p24 epitopes emerged after nearly two years of infection.

In contrast, mutations conferring CTL escape in the p24 epitopes significantly decreased viral fitness.

Differences between the subtypes in patterns of variability were most evident in the stem and turn regions of V3 (positions 9 to 24), with the two subtypes being very similar in the base region. The characteristics of the binding of V3 MAbs to Env proteins of the subtype B virus JR-FL and the subtype C virus BR025 suggested three patterns, as each group of MAbs recognized a specific conformation- or sequence-based epitope. Viruses pseudotyped with Env from JR-FL and BR025 were resistant to neutralization by the V3 MAbs, although the replacement of the Env V3 region of the SF162 virus with the JR-FL V3 created a pseudotyped virus that was hypersensitive to neutralization. A single mutation in V3 (H13R) made this chimeric Env selectively resistant to one group of V3 MAbs, consistent with the mAb binding properties. We hypothesize that there are intrinsic differences in V3 conformation between subtype B and subtype C that are localized to the stem and turn regions and that these differences have two important biological consequences: first, subtype B and subtype C V3 regions can have subtype-specific epitopes that will inherently limit antibody cross-reactivity, and second, V3 conformational differences may potentiate the frequent evolution of R5- into X4-tropic variants of subtype B but limit subtype C virus from using the same mechanism to evolve X4-tropic variants as efficiently.","author":"Patel MB","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.01444-07","matches":"mutation"},"17522223":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Binding Sites, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cell Line, Epitopes, Glycosylation, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV-1, Humans, Lectins, C-Type, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Polysaccharides, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptors, Cell Surface","date_submitted":"2007 Aug","title":"Identification of the optimal DC-SIGN binding site on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120.","abstract":"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (gp120) binding to DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin that can facilitate HIV infection in cis and in trans, is largely dependent on high-mannose-content moieties.

Soluble DC-SIGN was able to block 2G12 binding to gp120, but not vice versa, suggesting that DC-SIGN binds to a more flexible combination of N-glycans than 2G12. Consistent with this observation, HIV strain JRCSF gp120 prebound to 2G12 was 10-fold more sensitive to mannan competition than gp120 that was not prebound in a DC-SIGN cell surface binding assay. The analysis of multiple mutant forms of the 2G12 epitope revealed one triple glycosylation mutant form, termed 134mut (carrying N293Q, N382Q, and N388Q mutations), that exhibited a significant increase in sensitivity to both mannan competition and endoglycosidase H digestion compared to that of the 124mut form (carrying N293Q, N328Q, and N388Q mutations) and wild-type gp120 in a DC-SIGN binding assay. Importantly, no such differences were observed when binding to Galanthus nivalis was assessed. The 134mut form of gp120 also exhibited decreased binding to DC-SIGN in the context of native envelope spikes on a virion, and virus bearing 134mut exhibited less efficient DC-SIGN-mediated infection in trans. Significantly, 124mut and 134mut differed by only one glycosylation site mutation in each construct, and both 124mut and 134mut viruses exhibited wild-type levels of infectivity when used in a direct infection assay. In summary, while DC-SIGN can bind to a flexible combination of N-glycans on gp120, its optimal binding site overlaps with specific N-glycans within the 2G12 epitope.

In this study, the NMR structure of the V3 region of an R5 strain, HIV-1(JR-FL), in complex with an HIV-1-neutralizing antibody was determined. Positively charged and negatively charged residues at positions 304 and 322, respectively, oppose each other in the beta-hairpin structure, enabling a favorable electrostatic interaction that stabilizes the postulated R5 conformation. Comparison of the R5 conformation with the postulated X4 conformation of the V3 region (positively charged residue at position 322) reveals that electrostatic repulsion between residues 304 and 322 in X4 strains triggers the observed one register shift in the N-terminal strand of the V3 region. We posit that electrostatic interactions at the base of the V3 beta-hairpin can modulate the conformation and thereby influence the phenotype switch. In addition, we suggest that interstrand cation-pi interactions between positively charged and aromatic residues induce the switch to the X4 conformation as a result of the S306R mutation.

This conformational change can be measured as gating currents and is thought to be transferred to the pore domain via an annealing of the covalent link between voltage sensor and pore (S4-S5 linker) and the C terminus of the pore domain (S6). Upon prolonged depolarizations, the voltage dependence of the charge movement shifts to more hyperpolarized potentials. This mode shift had been linked to C-type inactivation but has recently been suggested to be caused by a relaxation of the voltage sensor itself. In this study, we identified two ShakerIR mutations in the S4-S5 linker (I384N) and S6 (F484G) that, when mutated, completely uncouple voltage sensor movement from pore opening. Using these mutants, we show that the pore transfers energy onto the voltage sensor and that uncoupling the pore from the voltage sensor leads the voltage sensors to be activated at more negative potentials. This uncoupling also eliminates the mode shift occurring during prolonged depolarizations, indicating that the pore influences entry into the mode shift. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry, we identified that the slow conformational change of the S4 previously correlated with the mode shift disappears when uncoupling the pore. The effects can be explained by a mechanical load that is imposed upon the voltage sensors by the pore domain and allosterically modulates its conformation. Mode shift is caused by the stabilization of the open state but leads to a conformational change in the voltage sensor.","author":"Haddad GA","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1085\/jgp.201010573","matches":"mutation, mutate, energy"},"21059661":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, CHO Cells, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, Humans, Ion Channel Gating, KCNQ1 Potassium Channel, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Mutation, Protein Conformation","date_submitted":"2011 Jan 7","title":"The S4-S5 linker of KCNQ1 channels forms a structural scaffold with the S6 segment controlling gate closure.","abstract":"In vivo, KCNQ1 \u03b1-subunits associate with the \u03b2-subunit KCNE1 to generate the slowly activating cardiac potassium current (I(Ks)).

The opening or closure of the intracellular channel gate, which localizes at the bottom of the S6 segment, is directly controlled by the movement of the VSD via an electromechanical coupling. In other Kv channels, this electromechanical coupling is realized by an interaction between the S4-S5 linker (S4S5(L)) and the C-terminal end of S6 (S6(T)). Previously we reported that substitutions for Leu(353) in S6(T) resulted in channels that failed to close completely. Closure could be incomplete because Leu(353) itself is the pore-occluding residue of the channel gate or because of a distorted electromechanical coupling. <b>To resolve this and to address the role of S4S5(L) in KCNQ1 channel gating, we performed an alanine\/tryptophan substitution scan of S4S5(L)<\/b>.

We examine such changes in Shaker channels lacking fast inactivation by considering the consequences of mutating two residues, T449 just external to the selectivity filter and V438 in the pore helix near the bottom of the selectivity filter. Single mutant T449F channels with the native V438 inactivate very slowly, and the canonical foot-in-the-door effect of extracellular tetraethylammonium (TEA) is not only absent, but the time course of slow inactivation is accelerated by TEA. The V438A mutation dramatically speeds inactivation in T449F channels, and TEA slows inactivation exactly as predicted by the foot-in-the-door model. We propose that TEA has this effect on V438A\/T449F channels because the V438A mutation produces allosteric consequences within the selectivity filter and may reorient the aromatic ring at position 449. We investigated the possibility that the blocker promotes the collapse of the outer vestibule (spring-in-the-door) in single mutant T449F channels by an electrostatic attraction between a cationic TEA and the quadrupole moments of the four aromatic rings. To test this idea, we used in vivo nonsense suppression to serially fluorinate the introduced aromatic ring at the 449 position, a manipulation that withdraws electrons from the aromatic face with little effect on the shape, net charge, or hydrophobicity of the aromatic ring. Progressive fluorination causes monotonically enhanced rates of inactivation. In further agreement with our working hypothesis, increasing fluorination of the aromatic gradually transforms the TEA effect from spring-in-the-door to foot-in-the-door.

TREK-2S phenotype shows a noisy open state with a mean conductance of 54 pS (+40 mV). TREK-2L phenotype shows a full open state (202 pS) with several short-lived sub-conductance levels.

Phosphorylation of TREK-2 produced by treatment of cells with activators of protein kinases A and C, and okadaic acid (a serine\/threonine phosphatase inhibitor) decreased the current contributed by TREK-2S and TREK-2L, and caused partial switching of conductance levels from those of TREK-2S and TREK-2L to more intermediate values.

Gd(+3) reduces peak currents (tonic block) and accelerates decay of ionic current during depolarization (use-dependent block). Because diffusion of Gd(3+) at concentrations used (<1 microM) is much slower than activation of the channel, the tonic effect is likely to be due to the blockage that occurred in closed channels before depolarization. We found that the dose-response curves for the two blocking effects of Gd(3+) shifted in parallel for Ba(2+), Sr(2+), and Ca(2+) currents through the wild-type channel, and for Ca(2+) currents through the selectivity filter mutation EEQE that lowers the blocking potency of Gd(3+). The correlation indicates that Gd(3+) binding to the same site causes both tonic and use-dependent blocking effects. The apparent on-rate for the tonic block increases with the prepulse voltage in the range -60 to -45 mV, where significant gating current but no ionic current occurs. When plotted together against voltage, the on-rates of tonic block (-100 to -45 mV) and of use-dependent block (-40 to 40 mV) fall on a single sigmoid that parallels the voltage dependence of the gating charge. The on-rate of tonic block by Gd(3+) decreases with concentration of Ba(2+), indicating that the apparent affinity of the site to permeant ions is about 1 mM in closed channels.

To probe the T20 structure-activity relationship, we engineered a molecular mimic of the entire gp41 N-HR coiled coil using the 5-Helix design strategy. <b>T20 bound this artificial protein (denoted 5H-ex) with nanomolar affinity (K(D) = 30 nm), close to its IC50 concentration (approximately 3 nm) but much weaker than the affinity of a related inhibitory C-peptide C37 (K(D) = 0.0007 nm)<\/b>.

Mutating three aromatic residues at the T20 C terminus (WNWF --> ANAA) had no effect on affinity, suggesting that these amino acids do not participate in T20 binding to the gp41 N-HR.

We propose and demonstrate by reciprocal amino acid substitutions between hagfish and human insulins that the reduced biological activity of hagfish insulin results from unfavorable substitutions, namely, A10 (Ile to Arg), B4 (Glu to Gly), B13 (Glu to Asn), and B21 (Glu to Val). We likewise suggest that the altered biological activity of lamprey insulin may reflect substitutions at A10 (Ile to Lys), B4 (Glu to Thr), and B17 (Leu to Val). The substitution of Asp at residue B10 in hagfish insulin and of His at residue A8 in both hagfish and lamprey insulins may help compensate for unfavorable changes in other regions of the molecules. The data support the concept that the set of unusual properties of insulins bearing certain mutations in the hexamerization surface may reflect those of the insulins evolutionarily closer to the ancestral insulin gene product.","author":"Sajid W","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi901269j","matches":"mutation"},"19321435":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Allosteric Regulation, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Chymotrypsin, Cross-Linking Reagents, Humans, Insulin, Light, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Peptide Mapping, Protein Structure, Secondary, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptor, Insulin, Sus scrofa","date_submitted":"2009 May 22","title":"Decoding the cryptic active conformation of a protein by synthetic photoscanning: insulin inserts a detachable arm between receptor domains.","abstract":"Proteins evolve in a fitness landscape encompassing a complex network of biological constraints. Because of the interrelation of folding, function, and regulation, the ground-state structure of a protein may be inactive. A model is provided by insulin, a vertebrate hormone central to the control of metabolism. Whereas native assembly mediates storage within pancreatic beta-cells, the active conformation of insulin and its mode of receptor binding remain elusive. Here, functional surfaces of insulin were probed by photocross-linking of an extensive set of azido derivatives constructed by chemical synthesis. Contacts are circumferential, suggesting that insulin is encaged within its receptor. Mapping of photoproducts to the hormone-binding domains of the insulin receptor demonstrated alternating contacts by the B-chain beta-strand (residues B24-B28). Whereas even-numbered probes (at positions B24 and B26) contact the N-terminal L1 domain of the alpha-subunit, odd-numbered probes (at positions B25 and B27) contact its C-terminal insert domain. This alternation corresponds to the canonical structure of abeta-strand (wherein successive residues project in opposite directions) and so suggests that the B-chain inserts between receptor domains. Detachment of a receptor-binding arm enables photo engagement of surfaces otherwise hidden in the free hormone. The arm and associated surfaces contain sites also required for nascent folding and self-assembly of storage hexamers. The marked compression of structural information within a short polypeptide sequence rationalizes the diversity of diabetes-associated mutations in the insulin gene.

Four distinct inhibitory classes were found as follows: 1) allosteric IGF-1 blockers, 2) allosteric IGF-2 blockers, 3) allosteric IGF-1 and IGF-2 blockers, and 4) competitive IGF-1 and IGF-2 blockers. The epitopes of representative antibodies from each of these classes were mapped using a purified IGF-1R library containing 64 mutations.

One class of allosteric IGF-1 and IGF-2 blocker was identified that bound a separate epitope on the outer surface of the FnIII-1 domain. Using various biophysical techniques, we show that the dual IGF blockers inhibit ligand binding using a spectrum of mechanisms ranging from highly allosteric to purely competitive.

However, through random mutagenesis and yeast display engineering, it has been possible to isolate scTCR mutants that are properly folded and displayed on the yeast surface. These displayed mutants can serve not only as a scaffold for further engineering but also as scTCR variants that exhibit favorable biophysical properties in Escherichia coli expression. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the V domain mutations that allowed display would be beneficial. Our goal here was to identify generalizable patterns of important mutations that can be applied to different TCRs. We compared five different scTCRs, four from mice and one from a human, for yeast surface display. Analysis of a collection of mutants revealed four distinct regions of TCR V domains that were most important for enabling surface expression: the Valpha-Vbeta interface, the HV4 of Vbeta, and the region of the Valpha and Vbeta domains normally apposed against the constant (C) domains. Consistent with the role of the V-C interface in surface display, reconstitution of this interface, by including the constant domains of each chain, allowed V domain display and alphabeta chain association on the yeast surface, thus providing an alternative TCR scaffold. However, the surface levels of TCR achieved with engineered scTCR mutants were superior to that of the ValphaCalpha\/VbetaCbeta constructs. Therefore, we describe further optimization of the current strategy for surface display of the single-chain format in order to facilitate yeast display engineering of a broader range of scTCRs.","author":"Richman SA","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molimm.2008.09.021","matches":"mutation"},"9927513":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antigen Presentation, Antigens, CD4, Histocompatibility Antigens Class II, Interleukin-2, Lymphocyte Activation, Models, Molecular, Mutation, Myelin Basic Protein, Peptide Fragments, Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta, T-Lymphocytes, Transfection","date_submitted":"1999 Feb 1","title":"Molecular requirements for T cell recognition by a major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted T cell receptor: the involvement of the fourth hypervariable loop of the Valpha domain.","abstract":"The role of two central residues (K68, E69) of the fourth hypervariable loop of the Valpha domain (HV4alpha) in antigen recognition by an MHC class II-restricted T cell receptor (TCR) has been analyzed.

Further, we studied the effect of two residues that likely made critical contact points in this interaction. We showed that a conserved tyrosine residue (Y116) on the convex surface of the LRR3 was a critical residue in ectodomain multimer formation since mutation of this residue to serine totally abrogated ectodomain multimers. This abrogation was not seen with the mutation of cysteine 176 on the inner side of the LRR5, demonstrating that inter-receptor disulfide bonding was not involved in ectodomain multimer formation. Additionally, the Y116 mutation in the intact wild type receptor enhanced receptor degradation.\n\nThese data establish the TSH receptor ectodomain as one site of multimerization, independent of the transmembrane region, and that this interaction was primarily via a conserved tyrosine residue in LRR3.","author":"Latif R","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0009449","matches":"mutation, energy"},"20181794":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Flow Cytometry, Leucine, Mice, Mice, Transgenic, Mutation, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptors, Thyrotropin, Signal Transduction, Thyrotropin","date_submitted":"2010 Apr","title":"Thyrotropin (TSH) receptor residue E251 in the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain is critical for linking TSH binding to receptor activation.","abstract":"The TSH receptor (TSHR) ectodomain comprises a tubular leucine-rich repeat domain (LRD) and a hinge [or signaling specificity domain (SSD)].

We exploited a fortuitous observation to obtain mechanistic insight into the relationship between TSH binding and signal transduction. A mouse TSHR cDNA generated by PCR was found to express a receptor with poor TSH-induced cAMP generation despite normal TSH binding. Progressive reversion to wild-type of six mutations revealed E251K in the LRD to be critical for reduced signal transduction in both mouse and human TSHR. An I286F substitution in the SSD had a much weaker effect and was additive with E251K. To our knowledge, there are no previous examples of specific amino acid mutations in the TSHR LRD that dissociate TSH binding from TSHR signal transduction. To prevent flailing of the TSHR LRD, its position vis-\u00e0-vis the SSD must be stabilized by multiple amino acid interactions. The present data suggest that TSHR residue E251 is one of these residues involved in stabilizing the LRD relative to the SSD, thereby enabling ligand binding to transduce a signal by the latter.

To characterize further the CS-17 epitope, we exploited the observation that CS-17 does not recognize a chimeric receptor with TSHR hinge region residues 261-289 replaced with homologous rat LH receptor residues (13 mismatches). We generated individual and double TSHR mutations corresponding to these mismatches. On flow cytometry, only T273L\/R274V reduced CS-17 recognition. No mutation affected TSH-stimulated cAMP generation. Because the immunogen for CS-17 generation was highly glycosylated, we also investigated whether the glycan moiety at N198, topologically adjacent to Y195 (a previously identified epitopic component), could contribute to the CS-17 epitope. Elimination of this N-linked glycan (mutations of N198 and T200) abrogated CS-17 binding without altering TSH responsiveness. However, studies with tunicamycin suggested that these mutations affected CS-17 binding by altering the polypeptide backbone rather than eliminating the glycan moiety. TSHR residues N198 and T200, like Y195, are on the convex facet of the leucine-rich domain.

We, therefore, combined and progressively extended previous deletions (Delta) in the TSH receptor (TSHR) hinge region (residues 277-418). TSHRDelta287-366, Delta287-371, Delta287-376, and Delta287-384 progressively lost their response to TSH stimulation of cAMP generation in intact cells, consistent with a progressive loss of TSH binding.

Therefore, LMO2 is necessary but not sufficient for overt neoplasias, which must undergo additional mutations before frank malignancy. An open question is the importance of LMO2 in tumor development as opposed to sustaining cancer. We have addressed this using a peptide aptamer that binds to the second LIM domain of the LMO2 protein and disrupts its function. This specificity is mediated by a conserved Cys-Cys motif, which is similar to the zinc-binding LIM domains.

Construction of envelop protein phylogeny by using MEGA 5 exhibit the active mutation pattern, increase in potential N-glycosylation sites which were predicted by using online software SignalP-NN. An online available tool Drawgram was used for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of HIV-1 subtype B envelop region and V3 loop while the alignment was rechecked by using CLUSTAL W and further was analyzed for GPGX motif and conserved region in V3 loop. Variation at fourth position of the GPGX motif and 60% conservation was found in V3 loop. Hence, this diversifying pattern of envelop protein in the Asia formulates the HIV-1 strains more pathogenic during the period of 17 years. These findings might help in understanding significant structural and functional constrains of the mutant viral strains and ultimately in vaccine development.","author":"Kanwal S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1100\/2012\/978917","matches":"mutation"},"22252820":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acid Substitution, Anti-HIV Agents, Antibodies, Blocking, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Cyclohexanes, Drug Resistance, Viral, HIV Fusion Inhibitors, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Piperazines, Pyrimidines, Receptors, CCR5, Triazoles","date_submitted":"2012 Apr","title":"Differential use of CCR5 by HIV-1 clinical isolates resistant to small-molecule CCR5 antagonists.","abstract":"How HIV-1 resistant to small-molecule CCR5 antagonists uses the coreceptor for entry has been studied in a limited number of isolates.

To obtain an understanding of this dramatic dependence of activity on mutation, we used first-principles-based methods to predict the ensemble of low-energy seven-helix conformations for the wild-type (WT) and mutants (T210A and T210I).

In contrast T210I has no such couplings across the receptor explaining the ease in activating this mutant. WT has just the TM3+TM6 coupling, known to be broken upon GPCR activation.

The ligand-activated intracellular signalling pathways result in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation. CXCR1 is a class A, rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the largest class of integral membrane proteins responsible for cellular signal transduction and targeted as drug receptors. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CXCR1 signal transduction is poorly understood owing to the limited structural information available. Recent structural determination of GPCRs has advanced by modifying the receptors with stabilizing mutations, insertion of the protein T4 lysozyme and truncations of their amino acid sequences, as well as addition of stabilizing antibodies and small molecules that facilitate crystallization in cubic phase monoolein mixtures. The intracellular loops of GPCRs are crucial for G-protein interactions, and activation of CXCR1 involves both amino-terminal residues and extracellular loops. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that IL-8 binding to the N-terminal residues is mediated by the membrane, underscoring the importance of the phospholipid bilayer for physiological activity.

Despite these distinctly different functions, a single residue substitution, Ala215 to Thr215 in the BR retinal-binding pocket, enables its photochemical reactions to transmit signals to HtrII and mediate phototaxis. We pursued a crystal structure of the signaling BR mutant (BR_A215T) to determine the structural changes caused by the A215T mutation and to assess what new photochemistry is likely to be introduced into the BR photoactive site. We crystallized BR_A215T from bicelles and solved its structure to 3.0 \u00c5 resolution to enable an atomic-level comparison. The analysis was complemented by molecular dynamics simulation of BR mutated in silico. Three main conclusions regarding the roles of photoactive site residues in signaling emerge from the comparison of BR_A215T, BR, and SRII structures: (i) the Thr215 residue in signaling BR is positioned nearly identically with respect to the retinal chromophore as in SRII, consistent with its role in producing a steric conflict with the retinal C\u2081\u2084 group during photoisomerization, proposed earlier to be essential for SRII signaling from vibrational spectroscopy and motility measurements; (ii) Tyr174-Thr204 hydrogen bonding, critical in SRII signaling and mimicked in signaling BR, is likely auxiliary, for example, to maintain Thr204 in the proper position for the steric trigger to occur; and (iii) the primary role of Arg72 in SRII is spectral tuning and not signaling.","author":"Spudich EN","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2011.11.025","matches":"mutation, mutate, x-ray, crystallography"},"22100461":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Endocytosis, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Genes, Reporter, Genotype, Lac Operon, Ligands, Membrane Proteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptides, Phenotype, Phosphorylation, Point Mutation, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptors, Mating Factor, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Serine, Signal Transduction, Threonine, Time Factors, Up-Regulation","date_submitted":"2012 Jan","title":"Multiple regulatory roles of the carboxy terminus of Ste2p a yeast GPCR.","abstract":"Signaling and internalization of Ste2p, a model G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are reported to be regulated by phosphorylation status of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues located in the cytoplasmic C-terminus.

The three dimensional structure of GPCRs is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and for performing structure-based drug design. Although structural data are restricted to only a handful of GPCRs, homology models can be used as a proxy for those receptors not having crystal structures. However, many researchers working on GPCRs are not experienced homology modellers and are therefore unable to benefit from the information that can be gleaned from such three-dimensional models. Here, we present a comprehensive database called the GPCR-SSFE, which provides initial homology models of the transmembrane helices for a large variety of family A GPCRs.\n\nExtending on our previous theoretical work, we have developed an automated pipeline for GPCR homology modelling and applied it to a large set of family A GPCR sequences. Our pipeline is a fragment-based approach that exploits available family A crystal structures.

The docking simulation predicted two candidate binding structures for a salicin-hTAS2R16 complex, and at least seven amino acid residues in transmembrane 3 (TM3), TM5, and TM6 were shown to be involved in ligand recognition. We also identified the probable salicin-hTAS2R16 binding mode using a mutated receptor experiment. This study characterizes the molecular interaction between hTAS2R16 and beta-D-glucopyranoside and will also facilitate rational design of bitter blockers.","author":"Sakurai T","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M110.144444","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"20562103":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acids, Animals, Cell Line, Epitopes, Humans, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Mice, Mice, Knockout, Models, Molecular, Protein Structure, Quaternary, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled, Structure-Activity Relationship","date_submitted":"2010 Aug 27","title":"Interactions between intracellular domains as key determinants of the quaternary structure and function of receptor heteromers.","abstract":"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromers are macromolecular complexes with unique functional properties different from those of its individual protomers.

In addition, NTS1-7m bound to NT was more stable than unliganded NTS1-7m. Of the four thermostabilizing mutations, only one residue (A86L) is predicted to be in the lipid environment. In contrast, I260A appears to be buried within the transmembrane helix bundle, F342A may form a distant part of the putative ligand-binding site, whereas F358A is likely to be in a region that is important for receptor activation. NTS1-7m binds NT with a similar affinity for the wild-type receptor. However, agonist dissociation was slower, and NTS1-7m activated G-proteins poorly. The affinity of NTS1-7m for the antagonist SR48692 was also lower than that of the wild-type receptor. Thus, we have successfully stabilized NTS1 in an agonist-binding conformation that does not efficiently couple to G-proteins.","author":"Shibata Y","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2009.04.068","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"19298394":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acids, Binding Sites, Humans, Protein Conformation, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","date_submitted":"2009 Mar","title":"Molecular basis for amino acid sensing by family C G-protein-coupled receptors.","abstract":"Family C of human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is constituted by eight metabotropic glutamate receptors, two gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B1-2)) subunits forming the heterodimeric GABA(B) receptor, the calcium-sensing receptor, three taste1 receptors (T1R1-3), a promiscuous L-alpha;-amino acid receptor G-protein-coupled receptor family C, group 6, subtype A (GPRC6A) and seven orphan receptors.

Cation-pi interactions exist between Lys-65, Arg-83, and Lys-132 in Bla g 2 and several tyrosines in 7C11. In the complex with Fab', Bla g 2 forms a dimer, which is stabilized by a quasi-four-helix bundle comprised of an alpha-helix and a helical turn from each allergen monomer, exhibiting a novel dimerization mode for an aspartic protease. A disulfide bridge between C51a and C113, unique to the aspartic protease family, connects the two helical elements within each Bla g 2 monomer, thus facilitating formation of the bundle.

Previous work from this laboratory has shown that synthetic peptides, corresponding to the uPAR(88-92) chemotactic sequence, when carrying the S90P or S90E substitutions, up- or down-regulate cell migration, respectively. To gain mechanistic insights into these opposite cell responses, the functional consequences of S90P and S90E mutations in full-length uPAR were evaluated. First, (HEK)-293 embryonic kidney cells expressing uPAR(S90P) exhibit enhanced FPR activation, increased random and directional cell migration, long-lasting Akt phosphorylation, and increased adhesion to vitronectin, as well as uPAR\/vitronectin receptor association. In contrast, the S90E substitution prevents agonist-triggered FPR activation and internalization, decreases binding and adhesion to vitronectin, and inhibits uPAR\/vitronectin receptor association. Also, 293\/uPAR(S90P) cells appear quite elongated and their cytoskeleton well organized, whereas 293\/uPAR(S90E) cells assume a large flattened morphology, with random orientation of actin filaments. Interestingly, when HT1080 cells co-express wild type uPAR with uPAR S90E, the latter behaves as a dominant-negative, impairing uPAR-mediated signaling and reducing cell wound repair as well as lung metastasis in nude mice. In contrast, signaling, wound repair and in vivo lung metastasis of HT1080 cells bearing wild type uPAR are enhanced when they co-express uPAR(S90P). In conclusion, our findings indicate that Ser(90) is a critical residue for uPAR signaling and that the S90P and S90E exert opposite effects on uPAR activities. These findings may be accommodated in a molecular model, in which uPAR(S90E) and uPAR(S90P) are forced into inactive and active forms, respectively, suggesting important implications for the development of novel drugs targeting uPAR function.","author":"Bifulco K","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0044806","matches":"mutation"},"23027977":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Calcification, Physiologic, Crystallography, X-Ray, Glycoproteins, Insulin, Mice, Models, Molecular, Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases, Protein Conformation, Pyrophosphatases, Ribonucleotides, Signal Transduction, X-Ray Diffraction","date_submitted":"2012 Oct 16","title":"Crystal structure of Enpp1, an extracellular glycoprotein involved in bone mineralization and insulin signaling.","abstract":"Enpp1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that regulates bone mineralization by hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotide triphosphates to produce pyrophosphate.

To gain insight into the cause of these major evolutionary events, we have retraced the history of cyt c loci among primates. For testis cyt c, all primate sequences examined carry the same nonsense mutation, which suggests that silencing occurred before the primates diversified. For somatic cyt c, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses yielded the same tree topology. The evolutionary analyses show that a fast accumulation of non-synonymous mutations (suggesting positive selection) occurred specifically on the anthropoid lineage root and then continued in parallel on the early catarrhini and platyrrhini stems. Analysis of evolutionary changes using the 3D structure suggests they are focused on the respiratory chain rather than on apoptosis or other cyt c functions. In agreement with previous biochemical studies, our results suggest that silencing of the cyt c testis isoform could be linked with the decrease of primate reproduction rate. Finally, the evolution of cyt c in the two sister anthropoid groups leads us to propose that somatic cyt c evolution may be related both to COX evolution and to the convergent brain and body mass enlargement in these two anthropoid clades.","author":"Pierron D","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0026269","matches":"mutation, energy"},"21454570":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Cytochromes b, Electron Transport Complex III, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli Proteins, Humans, Mitochondrial Diseases, Mutation, Missense, Plasmodium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Tyrosine","date_submitted":"2011 May 20","title":"Loss of a conserved tyrosine residue of cytochrome b induces reactive oxygen species production by cytochrome bc1.","abstract":"Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces oxidative damages, decreases cellular energy conversion efficiencies, and induces metabolic diseases in humans.

In this work mutations that were predicted to alter proton translocation and enzyme activity in preliminary computational studies are characterized with extensive experimental and computational analysis. The mutations were introduced in the D pathway, one of two proton-uptake pathways, in CytcO from Rhodobacter sphaeroides . Serine residues 200 and 201, which are hydrogen-bonded to crystallographically resolved water molecules halfway up the D pathway, were replaced by more bulky hydrophobic residues (Ser200Ile, Ser200Val\/Ser201Val, and Ser200Val\/Ser201Tyr) to query the effects of changing the local structure on enzyme activity as well as proton uptake, release, and intermediate transitions. In addition, the effects of these mutations on internal proton transfer were investigated by blocking proton uptake at the pathway entrance (Asp132Asn replacement in addition to the above-mentioned mutations). Even though the overall activities of all mutant CytcO's were lowered, both the Ser200Ile and Ser200Val\/Ser201Val variants maintained the ability to pump protons. The lowered activities were shown to be due to slowed oxidation kinetics during the P(R) \u2192 F and F \u2192 O transitions (P(R) is the \"peroxy\" intermediate formed at the catalytic site upon reaction of the four-electron-reduced CytcO with O(2), F is the oxoferryl intermediate, and O is the fully oxidized CytcO). Furthermore, the P(R) \u2192 F transition is shown to be essentially pH independent up to pH 12 (i.e., the apparent pK(a) of Glu286 is increased from 9.4 by at least 3 pK(a) units) in the Ser200Val\/Ser201Val mutant.

In the reduced-CO adduct of R481L, the frequencies of the Fe-CO and C-O stretching modes indicate that, unlike the wild type protein, the Cu(B) is no longer close to the heme-bound CO. In contrast, resonance Raman data obtained from the various oxidation and ligation states of the R481Q mutant are similar to those of the wild type protein, except that the mutation causes an enhancement of the relative intensity of the beta conformer of the CO-adduct, indicating a shift in the equilibrium between the alpha and beta conformers. The current findings, together with crystallographic structural data of heme-copper oxidases, indicate that R481 plays a keystone role in stabilizing the functional structure of the Cu(B) site through a hydrogen bonding network involving ordered water molecules.

While at acidic pH structural changes may be more significant because of a higher local protein flexibility, only limited alterations, possibly representing early events associated with protein destabilization, are generally induced by mutations.

However, when located in beta-strands, most of these mutations are predicted to destabilize the native beta-structure. The analysis also shows that rat and murine TTR have a lower intrinsic beta-aggregation propensity and a similar native beta-structure stability compared with human TTR. This result is consistent with the lack of in vitro amyloidogenicity found for both murine and rat TTR.

The effect is particularly evident when the mutation affects an interacting residue present in two distinct subunits of transthyretin participating simultaneously in two interactions with a retinol-binding protein molecule.

Remarkably, some of the residues in mutated human transthyretin that weaken or abolish the interaction with retinol-binding protein are present in piscine transthyretin, consistent with the lack of interaction between retinol-binding protein and transthyretin in fish.","author":"Zanotti G","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1742-4658.2008.06705.x","matches":"mutation, mutate, x-ray, crystallography, affinity"}},"19204296":{"22948149":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived, Cattle, Conserved Sequence, Deer, Directed Molecular Evolution, Epitope Mapping, Epitopes, Humans, Hybridomas, Mice, Mice, Transgenic, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Oxidation-Reduction, PrPC Proteins, PrPSc Proteins, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Saimiri, Sequence Deletion, Sheep","date_submitted":"2012 Oct 26","title":"Characterization of conformation-dependent prion protein epitopes.","abstract":"Whereas prion replication involves structural rearrangement of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), the existence of conformational epitopes remains speculative and controversial, and PrP transformation is monitored by immunoblot detection of PrP(27-30), a protease-resistant counterpart of the pathogenic scrapie form (PrP(Sc)) of PrP.

E286 mutations in each enzyme block proton flux and, therefore, inhibit oxidase function. In the current work, resonance Raman spectroscopy was used to show that the E286A and E286C mutations in RsCcO(aa3) result in long range conformational changes that influence the protein interactions with both heme a and heme a(3). Therefore, the severe reduction of the steady-state activity of the E286 mutants in RsCcO(aa3) to ~0.05% is not simply a result of the direct blockage of the D-channel, but it is also a consequence of the conformational changes induced by the mutations to heme a and to the heme a(3)-Cu(B) active site. In contrast, the E286C mutation of EcQO(bo3) exhibits no evidence of conformational changes at the two heme sites, indicating that its reduced activity (3%) is exclusively a result of the inhibition of proton transfer from the D-channel. We propose that in RsCcO(aa3), the E286 mutations severely perturb the active site through a close interaction with F282, which lies between E286 and the heme-copper active site. The local structure around E286 in EcQO(bo3) is different, providing a rationale for the very different effects of E286 mutations in the two enzymes.

The random orientation of AdiC in reconstituted liposomes throws up an obstacle to quantifying its transport mechanism. To overcome this problem, we introduced a mutation, S26C, near the substrate-binding site. This mutant exhibits substrate recognition and pH-dependent activity similar to those of the wild-type protein but loses function completely upon reaction with thiol reagents. The membrane-impermeant MTSES reagent can then be used as a cleanly sided inhibitor to silence those S26C-AdiC proteins whose extracellular portion projects from the external side of the liposome. Alternatively, the membrane-permeant MTSEA and membrane-impermeant reducing reagent, TCEP, can be used together to inhibit proteins in the opposite orientation. This approach allows steady-state kinetic analysis of AdiC in a sided fashion. Arginine and agmatine have similar Michaelis-Menten parameters for both sides of the protein, while the extracellular side selects arginine over argininamide, a mimic of the carboxylate-protonated form of arginine, more effectively than does the cytoplasmic side. Moreover, the two sides of AdiC have different pH sensitivities. AdiC activity increases to a plateau at pH 4 as the extracellular side is acidified, while the cytoplasmic side shows an optimal pH of 5.5, with further acidification inhibiting transport.

Investigation of TH transporters became one of the emerging fields in thyroid research after the discovery of inactivating mutations in the Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), which was found to be highly specific for TH transport. However, additional transmembrane transporters are also very important for TH uptake and efflux in different cell types. They transport TH as secondary substrates and include the aromatic amino acid transporting MCT10, the organic anion transporting polypeptides (e.g. OATP1C1, OATP1A2, OPTP1A4) and the large neutral amino acid transporters (LAT1 and LAT2). These TH transporters characteristically possess 12 transmembrane spanners but due to the strong differing sequences between the three transporter families we assume an identical conformation is not very likely. In contrast to the others, the LAT family members form a heterodimer with the escort protein 4F2hc\/CD98. A comparison of sequence proportions, locations and types of functional sensitive features for TH transport discovered by mutations, revealed that transport sensitive charged residues occur as conserved amino acids only within each family of the transporter types but not in all putative TH transporters. Based on the lack of highly conserved sensitive charged residues throughout the three transporter families as a common counterpart for the amino acid moiety of the substrates, we conclude that the molecular transport mechanism is likely organized either a) by different molecular determinants in the divergent transporter types or b) the counterparts for the substrates` amino acid moiety at the transporter are not any charged side chains but other proton acceptors or donators. However, positions of transport sensitive residues coincide at transmembrane helix 8 in the TH transporter MCT8, OATP1C1 and another amino acid transporter, the L-cystine and L-glutamate exchanger xCT, which is highly homologous to LAT1 and LAT2. Here we review the data available and compare similarities and differences between these primary and secondary TH transporters regarding sequences, topology, potential structures, trafficking to the plasma membrane, molecular features and locations of transport sensitive functionalities.

When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of G protein-coupled receptors, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R. Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific \"lid\" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII-bound wild-type AT1R. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the N111G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type AT1R. In contrast, AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant, which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [Sar(1),Gln(2),Ile(8)] AngII, a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII.

Many 7TM receptors contain a cysteine residue in the third extracellular loop (EC3) and a complementary cysteine residue on the N terminus. The functional role of such EC3-N terminus conserved cysteine pairs remains unclear. This study explores the role of the EC3-N terminus cysteine pairs on receptor conformation and G protein activation by disrupting them in the chemokine receptor CXCR4, while engineering a novel EC3-N terminus cysteine pair into the complement factor 5a receptor (C5aR), a chemo attractant receptor that lacks it. Mutated CXCR4 and C5aRs were expressed in engineered yeast. Mutation of the cysteine pair with the serine pair (C28S\/C274S) in constitutively active mutant CXCR4 abrogated the receptor activation, whereas mutation with the aromatic pair (C28F-C274F) or the salt bridge pair (C28R\/C274E), respectively, rescued or retained the receptor activation in response to CXCL12. In this context, the cysteine pair (Cys(30) and Cys(272)) engineered into the EC3-N terminus (Ser(30) and Ser(272)) of a novel constitutively active mutant of C5aR restrained the constitutive signaling without affecting the C5a-induced activation. Further mutational studies demonstrated a previously unappreciated role for Ser(272) on EC3 of C5aR and its interaction with the N terminus, thus defining a new microswitch region within the C5aR.

The N terminus of the mature receptor is extensively modified by sialylated mucin-type O-glycosylation in addition to one N-glycan attached to Asn(15).

Here, we report that both the PAR1 N terminus and ECL2 serve as sites for N-linked glycosylation but have different functions in the regulation of receptor signaling and trafficking. N-Linked glycosylation of the PAR1 N terminus is important for transport to the cell surface, whereas the PAR1 mutant lacking glycosylation at ECL2 (NA ECL2) trafficked to the cell surface like the wild-type receptor. However, activated PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant internalization was impaired compared with wild-type receptor, whereas constitutive internalization of unactivated receptor remained intact. Remarkably, thrombin-activated PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant displayed an enhanced maximal signaling response compared with wild-type receptor. The increased PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant signaling was not due to defects in the ability of thrombin to cleave the receptor or signal termination mechanisms. Rather, the PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant displayed a greater efficacy in thrombin-stimulated G protein signaling. Thus, N-linked glycosylation of the PAR1 extracellular surface likely influences ligand docking interactions and the stability of the active receptor conformation.

The binding of antibodies to their cognate antigens is governed by such biophysical properties of the interacting surfaces as shape, non-polar and polar surface area, and charge.\n\nTo understand forces shaping evolution of influenza virus, we have examined HA sequences of human influenza A and B viruses, assigning each amino acid values reflecting total accessible surface area, non-polar and polar surface area, and net charge due to the side chain. Changes in each of these values between neighboring sequences were calculated for each residue and mapped onto the crystal structures.\n\nAreas of HA showing the highest frequency of pairwise changes agreed well with previously identified antigenic sites in H3 and H1 HAs, and allowed us to propose more detailed antigenic maps and novel antigenic sites for H1 and influenza B HA. Changes in biophysical properties differed between HAs of different subtypes, and between different antigenic sites of the same HA. For H1, statistically significant differences in several biophysical quantities compared to residues lying outside antigenic sites were seen for some antigenic sites but not others. Influenza B antigenic sites all show statistically significant differences in biophysical quantities for all antigenic sites, whereas no statistically significant differences in biophysical quantities were seen for any antigenic site is seen for H3. In many cases, residues previously shown to be under positive selection at the genetic level also undergo rapid change in biophysical properties.\n\nThe biophysical consequences of amino acid changes introduced by antigenic drift vary from subtype to subtype, and between different antigenic sites.

Mutations that are distant from the antibody binding site can lead to escape, probably by changing the conformation or dynamics of Env; however, these changes are difficult to identify and define mechanistically. Here we describe a network analysis-based approach to identify potential allosteric immune evasion mechanisms using three known HIV-1 Env gp120 protein structures from two different clades, B and C. First, correlation and principal component analyses of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a high degree of long-distance coupled motions that exist between functionally distant regions within the intrinsic dynamics of the gp120 core, supporting the presence of long-distance communication in the protein. Then, by integrating MD simulations with network theory, we identified the optimal and suboptimal communication pathways and modules within the gp120 core. The results unveil both strain-dependent and -independent characteristics of the communication pathways in gp120. We show that within the context of three structurally homologous gp120 cores, the optimal pathway for communication is sequence sensitive, i.e. a suboptimal pathway in one strain becomes the optimal pathway in another strain. Yet the identification of conserved elements within these communication pathways, termed inter-modular hotspots, could present a new opportunity for immunogen design, as this could be an additional mechanism that HIV-1 uses to shield vulnerable antibody targets in Env that induce neutralizing antibody breadth.","author":"Sethi A","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1003046","matches":"mutation"},"23483107":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"","date_submitted":"2013","title":"Secondary mechanisms of diversification in the human antibody repertoire.","abstract":"V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are the primary mechanisms for diversification of the human antibody repertoire.

In virological and immunological tests, MAb 19e did not bind native or constrained gp120 except in the presence of CD4. This contrasted with other anti-CD4i MAbs, including MAb 21c, which bound unliganded, full-length gp120 held in a constrained conformation. Conversely, MAb 19e exhibited no specific reactivity with free human CD4. Computational modeling of MAb 19e interactions with gp120-CD4 complexes suggested a distinct binding profile involving antibody heavy chain interactions with CD4 and light chain interactions with gp120. In accordance, targeted mutations in CD4 based on this model specifically reduced MAb 19e interactions with stable gp120-CD4 complexes that retained reactivity with other anti-CD4i MAbs. These data represent a rare instance of an antibody response that is specific to a pathogen-host cell protein interaction and underscore the diversity of immunogenic CD4i epitope structures that exist during natural infection.","author":"Lewis GK","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.05072-11","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"21931643":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Antibody Specificity, B-Lymphocytes, Clone Cells, Cross Reactions, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Epitope Mapping, Epitopes, HEK293 Cells, HIV Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Immunologic Memory, Molecular Sequence Data, Neutralization Tests, Phylogeny, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Surface Plasmon Resonance, env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2011","title":"Memory B cell antibodies to HIV-1 gp140 cloned from individuals infected with clade A and B viruses.","abstract":"Understanding the antibody response to HIV-1 in humans that show broad neutralizing serologic activity is a crucial step in trying to reproduce such responses by vaccination.

In a small minority of cases, infection with nef\/3'LTR deleted attenuated viral strains allowed control over viral replication. A common feature of LTNP is the readily detected proliferation of CD4 T-cells in vitro, in response to p24. In some cases, the responding CD4 T-cells have cytotoxic effector function and may target conserved p24 epitopes, similar to the CD8 T-cells described below. LTNP may also carry much lower HIV DNA burden in key CD4 subsets, presumably resulting from lower viral replication during primary infection. Some studies, but not others, suggest that LTNP have CD4 T-cells that are relatively resistant to HIV infection in vitro. One possible mechanism may involve up-regulation of the cell cycle regulator p21\/waf in CD4 T-cells from LTNP. Delayed progression in Caucasian LTNP is also partly associated with heterozygosity of the \u039432 CCR5 allele, probably through decreased expression of CCR5 co-receptor on CD4 T-cells. However, in approximately half of Caucasian LTNP, two host genotypes, namely HLA-B57 and HLA-B27, are associated with viral control. Immunodominant CD8 T-cells from these individuals target epitopes in p24 that are highly conserved, and escape mutations have significant fitness costs to the virus. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that these CD8 T-cells from LTNP, but not from HLA-B27 or HLA-B57 progressors, can cross-react with intermediate escape mutations, preventing full escape via compensatory mutations. Humoral immunity appears to play little part in LTNP subjects, since broadly neutralizing antibodies are rare, even amongst slow progressors. Recent genome-wide comparisons between LTNP and progressors have confirmed the HLA-B57, HLA-B27, and delta32 CCR5 allelic associations, plus indicated a role for HLA-C\/KIR interactions, but have not revealed any new genotypes so far.

Polymorphism 172K significantly suppressed zidovudine resistance caused by excision (e.g. thymidine-associated mutations) and not by discrimination mechanism mutations (e.g. Q151M complex). Moreover, it attenuated resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz imparted by NNRTI mutations. Although 172K favored RT-DNA binding at an excisable pre-translocation conformation, it decreased excision by thymidine-associated mutation-containing RT. 172K affected DNA handling and decreased RT processivity without significantly affecting the k(cat)\/K(m) values for dNTP. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that RT(172K) decreased DNA binding by increasing the dissociation rate.

To date, an integrated mathematical model that could allow the analysis of their mechanism of action, of the various resistance mechanisms, and their effect on viral fitness is still lacking. We present the first mechanistic mathematical model of polymerase inhibition by NAs that takes into account the reversibility of polymerase inhibition. Analytical solutions for the model point out the cellular- and kinetic aspects of inhibition. Our model correctly predicts for HIV-1 that resistance against nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can be conferred by decreasing their incorporation rate, increasing their excision rate, or decreasing their affinity for the polymerase enzyme. For all analyzed NRTIs and their combinations, model-predicted macroscopic parameters (efficacy, fitness and toxicity) were consistent with observations. NRTI efficacy was found to greatly vary between distinct target cells. Surprisingly, target cells with low dNTP\/NTP levels may not confer hyper-susceptibility to inhibition, whereas cells with high dNTP\/NTP contents are likely to confer natural resistance. Our model also allows quantification of the selective advantage of mutations by integrating their effects on viral fitness and drug susceptibility. For zidovudine triphosphate (AZT-TP), we predict that this selective advantage, as well as the minimal concentration required to select thymidine-associated mutations (TAMs) are highly cell-dependent. The developed model allows studying various resistance mechanisms, inherent fitness effects, selection forces and epistasis based on microscopic kinetic data.

We measured the rate constants governing nucleotide binding and enzyme isomerization for TTP and AZT-triphosphate by the wild-type and AZT-resistant forms of the enzyme containing the thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). We show that the TAMs alter the kinetics of AZT incorporation by weakening ground-state nucleotide binding and decreasing the rate of chemistry relative to the wild-type enzyme.

Molecular dynamics studies based on models of wild-type HIV-1 RT and mutant \u039469, \u039467\/T69G\/K70R, and D67N\/K70R RTs support a relevant role for Lys\/Arg-70 in the excision reaction. In \u039469 RT, the side chain of Lys-70 locates away from the putative pyrophosphate binding site. Therefore, its participation in interactions required for the excision reaction is unlikely. Our theoretical studies also suggest a role for Lys-219 in thymidine analog excision\/discrimination. However, pre-steady-state kinetics revealed only minor differences in selectivity of AZT-triphosphate versus dTTP between deletion-containing RTs and their homologous enzymes having the K219E mutation. K219E reduced both ATP- and pyrophosphate-mediated excision of primers terminated with thymidine analogues, only when introduced in RTs bearing \u039469 or S68G\/\u039469\/K70G, providing further biochemical evidence that explains the lack of association of \u039469 and TAMs in HIV-1 isolates.","author":"Kisic M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M111.226100","matches":"mutation"},"21402840":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Base Sequence, Drug Resistance, Viral, Guanosine, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Structure-Activity Relationship","date_submitted":"2011 Jun","title":"Mechanism of resistance to GS-9148 conferred by the Q151L mutation in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.","abstract":"GS-9148 is an investigational phosphonate nucleotide analogue inhibitor of reverse transcriptase (RT) (NtRTI) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This compound is an adenosine derivative with a 2',3'-dihydrofuran ring structure that contains a 2'-fluoro group. The resistance profile of GS-9148 is unique in that the inhibitor can select for the very rare Q151L mutation in HIV-1 RT as a pathway to resistance. Q151L is not stably selected by any of the approved nucleoside or nucleotide analogues; however, it may be a transient intermediate that leads to the related Q151M mutation, which confers resistance to multiple compounds that belong to this class of RT inhibitors. Here, we employed pre-steady-state kinetics to study the impact of Q151L on substrate and inhibitor binding and the catalytic rate of incorporation. Most importantly, we found that the Q151L mutant is unable to incorporate GS-9148 under single-turnover conditions. Interference experiments showed that the presence of GS-9148-diphosphate, i.e., the active form of the inhibitor, does not reduce the efficiency of incorporation for the natural counterpart. We therefore conclude that Q151L severely compromises binding of GS-9148-diphosphate to RT. This effect is highly specific, since we also demonstrate that another NtRTI, tenofovir, is incorporated with selectivity similar to that seen with wild-type RT. Incorporation assays with other related compounds and models based on the RT\/DNA\/GS-9148-diphosphate crystal structure suggest that the 2'-fluoro group of GS-9148 may cause steric hindrance with the side chain of the Q151L mutant.","author":"Scarth BJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/AAC.01738-10","matches":"mutation"},"21343443":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Anti-HIV Agents, Cell Line, DNA Replication, Deoxyadenosines, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Polymerase Chain Reaction","date_submitted":"2011 May","title":"4'-C-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine and 4'-C-ethyl-2'-deoxyadenosine inhibit HIV-1 replication.","abstract":"It is important to develop new anti-HIV drugs that are effective against the existing drug-resistant mutants.

We have isolated from a TFV-DF-treated HIV patient a Q151Mc-containing clinical isolate with high phenotypic resistance to TFV-DF. Analysis of the genotypic and phenotypic testing over the course of this patient's therapy lead us to hypothesize that TFV-DF resistance emerged upon appearance of the previously unreported K70Q mutation in the Q151Mc background. Virological analysis showed that HIV with only K70Q was not significantly resistant to TFV-DF. However, addition of K70Q to the Q151Mc background significantly enhanced resistance to several approved NRTIs, and also resulted in high-level (10-fold) resistance to TFV-DF. Biochemical experiments established that the increased resistance to tenofovir is not the result of enhanced excision, as K70Q\/Q151Mc RT exhibited diminished, rather than enhanced ATP-based primer unblocking activity. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzymes demonstrated that addition of the K70Q mutation selectively decreases the binding of tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), resulting in reduced incorporation of TFV into the nascent DNA chain. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that changes in the hydrogen bonding pattern in the polymerase active site of K70Q\/Q151Mc RT may contribute to the observed changes in binding and incorporation of TFV-DP.

Three-dimensional mapping of human sequences shows a non-uniform distribution of GPCRs, organized in clusters that lay along four privileged directions. To interpret these directions, we projected supplementary sequences from different species onto the human space used as a reference. With this technique, we can easily monitor the evolutionary drift of several GPCR sub-families from cnidarians to humans. Results support a model of radiative evolution of class A GPCRs from a central node formed by peptide receptors. The privileged directions obtained from the MDS analysis are interpretable in terms of three main evolutionary pathways related to specific sequence determinants. The first pathway was initiated by a deletion in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) and led to three sub-families by divergent evolution. The second pathway corresponds to the differentiation of the amine receptors. The third pathway corresponds to parallel evolution of several sub-families in relation with a covarion process involving proline residues in TM2 and TM5. As exemplified with GPCRs, the MDS projection technique is an important tool to compare orthologous sequence sets and to help decipher the mutational events that drove the evolution of protein families.","author":"Pel\u00e9 J","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0019094","matches":"mutation"},"21501622":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Adenosine A2 Receptor Agonists, Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide), Amino Acid Sequence, Humans, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Protein Stability, Protein Unfolding, Receptor, Adenosine A2A","date_submitted":"2011 Jun 10","title":"Thermostabilisation of an agonist-bound conformation of the human adenosine A(2A) receptor.","abstract":"The adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in transmembrane signalling mediated by the agonist adenosine.

We find 14 strong polar interactions of Exe4 with GLP1R, of which 8 interactions are in the TM bundle (2 interactions confirmed by mutation studies) and 6 interactions involve the N terminus (3 interactions found in the crystal structure). We also find 10 important hydrophobic interactions, of which 4 interactions are in the TM bundle (2 interactions confirmed by mutation studies) and 6 interactions are in the N terminus (6 interactions present in the crystal structure). Thus, our predicted structure agrees with available mutagenesis studies. We suggest a number of mutation experiments to further validate our predicted structure. The structure should be useful for guiding drug design and can provide a structural basis for understanding ligand binding and receptor activation of GLP1R and other class B1 GPCRs.","author":"Kirkpatrick A","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1218051109","matches":"mutation, x-ray"},"23109431":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Binding Sites, Calcium, Fluorescent Antibody Technique, GTP-Binding Proteins, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, Ligands, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Nonlinear Dynamics, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Receptors, Epoprostenol, Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2, Signal Transduction","date_submitted":"2013 Jan","title":"New insights into structural determinants for prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor- and prostacyclin receptor-G protein coupling.","abstract":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact with heterotrimeric G proteins and initiate a wide variety of signaling pathways. The molecular nature of GPCR-G protein interactions in the clinically important thromboxane A2 (TxA(2)) receptor (TP) and prostacyclin (PGI(2)) receptor (IP) is poorly understood. The TP activates its cognate G protein (G\u03b1q) in response to the binding of thromboxane, while the IP signals through G\u03b1s in response to the binding of prostacyclin. Here, we utilized a combination of approaches consisting of chimeric receptors, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis to precisely study the specificity of G protein coupling. Multiple chimeric receptors were constructed by replacing the TP intracellular loops (ICLs) with the ICL regions of the IP.

This increased diversity of cell signaling options caused by the generation of splice variants is further enhanced by receptor dimerization. When alternative splicing generates highly truncated GPCRs with less than seven transmembrane (TM) domains, the predominant effect in vitro is that of a dominant-negative mutation associated with the retention of the wild-type receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). For constitutively active (agonist-independent) GPCRs, their attenuated expression on the cell surface, and consequent decreased basal activity due to the dominant-negative effect of truncated splice variants, has pathological consequences. Truncated splice variants may conversely offer protection from disease when expression of co-receptors for binding of infectious agents to cells is attenuated due to ER retention of the wild-type co-receptor. In this review, we will see that GPCRs retained in the ER can still be functionally active but also that highly truncated GPCRs may also be functionally active. Although rare, some truncated splice variants still bind ligand and activate cell signaling responses. More importantly, by forming heterodimers with full-length GPCRs, some truncated splice variants also provide opportunities to generate receptor complexes with unique pharmacological properties. So, instead of assuming that highly truncated GPCRs are associated with faulty transcription processes, it is time to reassess their potential benefit to the host organism.","author":" ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1750-2187-7-13","matches":"mutation"},"22875855":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Catalytic Domain, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Hydroxycholesterols, Molecular Docking Simulation, Mutation, Missense, Protein Binding, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","date_submitted":"2012 Oct 12","title":"Molecular characterization of oxysterol binding to the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (GPR183).","abstract":"Oxysterols are oxygenated cholesterol derivates that are emerging as a physiologically important group of molecules. Although they regulate a range of cellular processes, only few oxysterol-binding effector proteins have been identified, and the knowledge of their binding mode is limited. Recently, the family of G protein-coupled seven transmembrane-spanning receptors (7TM receptors) was added to this group. Specifically, the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2 or GPR183) was shown to be activated by several oxysterols, most potently by 7\u03b1,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7\u03b1,25-OHC). Nothing is known about the binding mode, however. Using mutational analysis, we identify here four key residues for 7\u03b1,25-OHC binding: Arg-87 in TM-II (position II:20\/2.60), Tyr-112 and Tyr-116 (positions III:09\/3.33 and III:13\/3.37) in TM-III, and Tyr-260 in TM-VI (position VI:16\/6.51). Substituting these residues with Ala and\/or Phe results in a severe decrease in agonist binding and receptor activation. Docking simulations suggest that Tyr-116 interacts with the 3\u03b2-OH group in the agonist, Tyr-260 with the 7\u03b1-OH group, and Arg-87, either directly or indirectly, with the 25-OH group, although nearby residues likely also contribute. In addition, Tyr-112 is involved in 7\u03b1,25-OHC binding but via hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we show that II:20\/2.60 constitutes an important residue for ligand binding in receptors carrying a positively charged residue at this position. This group is dominated by lipid- and nucleotide-activated receptors, here exemplified by the CysLTs, P2Y12, and P2Y14. In conclusion, we present the first molecular characterization of oxysterol binding to a 7TM receptor and identify position II:20\/2.60 as a generally important residue for ligand binding in certain 7TM receptors.","author":"Benned-Jensen T","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M112.387894","matches":"mutation"},"22821234":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Motifs, Animals, Arrestin, Calcium, Cell Line, Cercopithecus aethiops, Clozapine, Cyclic AMP, GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Humans, Insulin, Insulin-Secreting Cells, Mice, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3, Phosphorylation, Point Mutation, Protein Engineering, Protein Multimerization, Radioligand Assay, Receptor, Muscarinic M3, Signal Transduction","date_submitted":"2012 Oct","title":"Design and functional characterization of a novel, arrestin-biased designer G protein-coupled receptor.","abstract":"Mutational modification of distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes has yielded novel designer G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are unable to bind acetylcholine (ACh), the endogenous muscarinic receptor ligand, but can be efficiently activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), an otherwise pharmacologically inert compound. These CNO-sensitive designer GPCRs [alternative name: designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADDs)] have emerged as powerful new tools to dissect the in vivo roles of distinct G protein signaling pathways in specific cell types or tissues. As is the case with other GPCRs, CNO-activated DREADDs not only couple to heterotrimeric G proteins but can also recruit proteins of the arrestin family (arrestin-2 and -3). Accumulating evidence suggests that arrestins can act as scaffolding proteins to promote signaling through G protein-independent signaling pathways. To explore the physiological relevance of these arrestin-dependent signaling pathways, the availability of an arrestin-biased DREADD would be highly desirable. In this study, we describe the development of an M\u2083 muscarinic receptor-based DREADD [Rq(R165L)] that is no longer able to couple to G proteins but can recruit arrestins and promote extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1\/2 phosphorylation in an arrestin- and CNO-dependent fashion. Moreover, CNO treatment of mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells expressing the Rq(R165L) construct resulted in a robust, arrestin-dependent stimulation of insulin release, directly implicating arrestin signaling in the regulation of insulin secretion.

In this study, molecular modeling revealed possible conformations for the extracellular loops of the C5a receptors with mutations in the EC2 loop or in the EC3 loop. Comparison of low-energy conformations of the EC loops defined two distinct clusters of conformations typical either for strongly constitutively active mutants of C5aR (the CAM cluster) or for nonconstitutively active mutants (the non-CAM cluster). In the CAM cluster, the EC3 loop was turned towards the transmembrane (TM) helical bundle and more closely interacted with EC2 than in the non-CAM cluster. This suggested a structural mechanism of constitutive activity where EC3 contacts EC2 leading to EC2 interactions with helix TM3, thus triggering movement of TM7 towards TM2 and TM3. The movement initiates rearrangement of the system of hydrogen bonds between TM2, TM3 and TM7 including formation of the hydrogen bond between the side chains of D82(2.50) in TM2 and N296(7.49) in TM7, which is crucial for formation of the activated states of the C5a receptors (Nikiforovich et al., Proteins: Struct Funct Gene 2011;79:787-802). Since the relative large length of EC3 in C5aR (13 residues) is comparable with those in many other members of rhodopsin family of GPCRs (13-19 residues), our findings might reflect general mechanisms of receptor constitutive activation.

Methods: 454-deep pyrosequencing in combination with a novel analysis pipeline was applied to define populations of IGHM CDRH3 sequences based on absence or presence of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in peripheral blood B cells. Results: HIV or SLE subjects have reduced biodiversity within their IGHM transcriptome compared to healthy subjects, mainly due to a significant decrease in the number of unique combinations of alleles, although recombination machinery was intact. While major differences between sequences without or with SHM occurred among all groups, IGHD and IGHJ allele use, CDRH3 length distribution, or generation of SHM were similar among study cohorts. Antiretroviral therapy failed to normalize IGHM biodiversity in HIV-infected individuals. All subjects had a low frequency of allelic combinations within the IGHM repertoire similar to known broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies.

The na\u00efve TCR repertoire is constrained by thymic selection, and TCR repertoire studies have therefore focused strongly on the diversity of MHC-binding complementarity determining region (CDR) CDR3. The process of somatic point mutations has given B cell studies a major focus on variable (IGHV, IGLV, and IGKV) genes. This in turn has influenced how both the na\u00efve and memory BCR repertoires have been studied. Diversity (D) genes are also more easily identified in BCR VDJ rearrangements than in TCR VDJ rearrangements, and this has allowed the processes and elements that contribute to the incredible diversity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain CDR3 to be analyzed in detail. This diversity can be contrasted with that of the light chain where a small number of polypeptide sequences dominate the repertoire. Biases in the use of different germline genes, in gene processing, and in the addition of non-template encoded nucleotides appear to be intrinsic to the recombination process, imparting \"shape\" to the repertoire of rearranged genes as a result of differences spanning many orders of magnitude in the probabilities that different BCRs will be generated.

Mutation of Glu126 (helix IV) or Arg144 (helix V), which are essential for sugar binding, completely blocks sugar-induced periplasmic opening as expected. Remarkably, however, replacement of Glu269 (helix VIII), His322 (helix X), or Tyr236 (helix VII) causes spontaneous opening of the periplasmic cavity in the absence of sugar and decreased closing of the cytoplasmic cavity in the presence of galactoside. In contrast, mutation of Arg302 (helix IX) or Glu325 (helix X) has no such effect, and sugar binding induces normal opening and closing of periplasmic and cytoplasmic cavities.

These emerging pathogens are responsible for more than 100 million human infections annually. Severe clinical manifestations of disease are predominantly associated with a secondary infection by a heterotypic DENV serotype. The increased risk of severe disease in DENV-sensitized populations significantly complicates vaccine development, as a vaccine must simultaneously confer protection against all four DENV serotypes. Eliciting a protective tetravalent neutralizing antibody response is a major goal of ongoing vaccine development efforts. However, a recent large clinical trial of a candidate live-attenuated DENV vaccine revealed low protective efficacy despite eliciting a neutralizing antibody response, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the humoral immune response against dengue infection. In this study, we sought to identify epitopes recognized by serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies elicited by monovalent DENV1 vaccination. We constructed a panel of over 50 DENV1 structural gene variants containing substitutions at surface-accessible residues of the envelope (E) protein to match the corresponding DENV2 sequence. Amino acids that contribute to recognition by serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies were identified as DENV mutants with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by DENV1 immune sera, but not cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies elicited by DENV2 vaccination. We identified two mutations (E126K and E157K) that contribute significantly to type-specific recognition by polyclonal DENV1 immune sera. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of sera from 24 participants of a phase I clinical study revealed a markedly reduced capacity to neutralize a E126K\/E157K DENV1 variant. Sera from 77% of subjects recognized the E126K\/E157K DENV1 variant and DENV2 equivalently (<3-fold difference). These data indicate the type-specific component of the DENV1 neutralizing antibody response to vaccination is strikingly focused on just two amino acids of the E protein. This study provides an important step towards deconvoluting the functional complexity of DENV serology following vaccination.","author":"Vanblargan LA","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1003761","matches":"mutation"}},"22451694":{"23114595":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antigens, CD151, Antigens, CD29, Base Sequence, Cells, Cultured, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Fatal Outcome, Female, Gene Expression, Genetic Association Studies, Glomerular Mesangium, Glycosylation, Humans, Infant, Integrin alpha3, Lung Diseases, Interstitial, Models, Molecular, Nephrotic Syndrome, Pedigree, Podocytes, Point Mutation, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Protein Multimerization, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Proteolysis, Sequence Analysis, DNA","date_submitted":"2012 Dec 3","title":"Gain of glycosylation in integrin \u03b13 causes lung disease and nephrotic syndrome.","abstract":"Integrins are transmembrane \u03b1\u03b2 glycoproteins that connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton.

While efforts to grab the physical principles of undesired molecule properties from the very bottom are becoming increasingly powerful, the wealth of publically available antibody sequences provides an alternative way to develop early assessment strategies for antibodies using a statistical approach which is the objective of this paper. Here, publically available sequences were used to develop heuristic potentials for the framework regions of heavy and light chains of antibodies of human and murine origin. The potentials take into account position dependent probabilities of individual amino acids but also conditional probabilities which are inevitable for sequence assessment and optimization. It is shown that the potentials derived from human sequences clearly distinguish between human sequences and sequences from mice and, hence, can be used as a measure of humaness which compares a given sequence with the phenotypic pool of human sequences instead of comparing sequence identities to germline genes. Following this line, it is demonstrated that, using the developed potentials, humanization of an antibody can be described as a simple mathematical optimization problem and that the in-silico generated framework variants closely resemble native sequences in terms of predicted immunogenicity.","author":" ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0076909","matches":"mutation"},"23620516":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antigens, CD11b, Autoantibodies, B-Lymphocytes, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Epitope Mapping, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, Humans, Immunologic Memory, Inhibitory Concentration 50, Kinetics, Mutation, Neutrophils, Point Mutation, Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis, Surface Plasmon Resonance, T-Lymphocytes","date_submitted":"2013 May 7","title":"Characterization of pathogenic human monoclonal autoantibodies against GM-CSF.","abstract":"The origin of pathogenic autoantibodies remains unknown.

Surprisingly, the synthetic repertoire yielded numerous functional antibodies that contained mutated CDR-L3 sequences but a fixed CDR-H3 sequence. Alanine-scanning analysis of antibodies that recognized 10 different antigens but contained a common CDR-H3 loop showed that, in most cases, the fixed CDR-H3 sequence was able to contribute favorably to antigen recognition, but in some cases, the loop was functionally inert. Structural analysis of one such antibody in complex with antigen showed that the inert CDR-H3 loop was nonetheless highly buried at the antibody-antigen interface. Taken together, these results show that CDR-H3 diversity is not necessarily required for the generation of antibodies that recognize diverse protein antigens with high affinity and specificity, and if given the chance, CDR-L3 readily assumes the dominant role for antigen recognition. These results contrast with the commonly accepted view of antigen recognition derived from the analysis of natural antibodies, in which CDR-H3 is presumed to be dominant and CDR-L3 is presumed to play an auxiliary role. Furthermore, the results show that natural antibody function is genetically constrained, and it should be possible to develop more functional synthetic antibody libraries by expanding the diversity of CDR-L3 beyond what is observed in nature.","author":"Persson H","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2012.11.037","matches":"mutate, alanine, x-ray, crystallography, affinity"}},"23357170":{"23357170":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Crystallography, X-Ray, DNA Mutational Analysis, Immunologic Factors, Interleukin-13, Models, Molecular, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Signal Transduction","date_submitted":"2013 Apr 26","title":"Structural basis of signaling blockade by anti-IL-13 antibody Lebrikizumab.","abstract":"The cytokine interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a major effector molecule for T-helper type 2 inflammation and is pathogenic in allergic diseases such as asthma.

Previous immunochemical and surface plasmon resonance-based studies have shown that these antibodies differ widely in their tolerance of mutations in the epitope. While HH8 is the most cross-reactive, HH26 is rigidified by a more extensive network of intramolecular salt links and is highly specific, with both association and dissociation rates strongly affected by epitope mutations. HH10 is of intermediate specificity, and epitope mutations produce changes primarily in the dissociation rate. Calorimetric characterization of the association energetics of these three antibodies with the native antigen HEL and with Japanese quail egg white lysozyme (JQL), a naturally occurring avian variant, shows that the energetics of interaction correlate with cross-reactivity and specificity. These results suggest that the greater cross-reactivity of HH8 may be mediated by a combination of conformational flexibility and less specific intermolecular interactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that upon association HH8 incurs the largest configurational entropic penalty and also the smallest loss of enthalpic driving force with variant antigen. Much smaller structural perturbations are expected in the formation of the less flexible HH26 complex, and the large loss of enthalpic driving force observed with variant antigen reflects its specificity. The observed thermodynamic parameters correlate well with the observed functional behavior of the antibodies and illustrate fundamental differences in thermodynamic characteristics between cross-reactive and specific molecular recognition.","author":"Mohan S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi801901d","matches":"mutation"},"16606676":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte, B-Lymphocytes, Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Germinal Center, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Plasma Cells, Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell","date_submitted":"2006 Apr 17","title":"Antigen recognition strength regulates the choice between extrafollicular plasma cell and germinal center B cell differentiation.","abstract":"B cells responding to T-dependent antigen either differentiate rapidly into extrafollicular plasma cells or enter germinal centers and undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. However, the physiological cues that direct B cell differentiation down one pathway versus the other are unknown. Here we show that the strength of the initial interaction between B cell receptor (BCR) and antigen is a primary determinant of this decision. B cells expressing a defined BCR specificity for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) were challenged with sheep red blood cell conjugates of a series of recombinant mutant HEL proteins engineered to bind this BCR over a 10,000-fold affinity range. Decreasing either initial BCR affinity or antigen density was found to selectively remove the extrafollicular plasma cell response but leave the germinal center response intact. Moreover, analysis of competing B cells revealed that high affinity specificities are more prevalent in the extrafollicular plasma cell versus the germinal center B cell response. Thus, the effectiveness of early T-dependent antibody responses is optimized by preferentially steering B cells reactive against either high affinity or abundant epitopes toward extrafollicular plasma cell differentiation. Conversely, responding clones with weaker antigen reactivity are primarily directed to germinal centers where they undergo affinity maturation.","author":"Paus D","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.20060087","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"12718755":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"B-Lymphocytes, Clone Cells, Codon, Female, Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Genes, Immunoglobulin, Germinal Center, Humans, Immunochemistry, Immunoglobulin Variable Region, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Serine, Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin, Spleen","date_submitted":"2003","title":"The VH gene repertoire of splenic B cells and somatic hypermutation in systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) it has been hypothesized that self-reactive B cells arise from virgin B cells that express low-affinity, nonpathogenic germline V genes that are cross-reactive for self and microbial antigens, which convert to high-affinity autoantibodies via somatic hypermutation.

There was similar use of diversity (D) and joining (JH) gene segments between clones from young and old donors, and there was similar use of D segments among the mutated and non-mutated heavy chains. However, in the mutated heavy chains, there was increased use of shorter JH4 segments and decreased use of longer JH6 segments compared to the non-mutated proteins. The overall length of CDR3 did not change with age within the mutated and non-mutated categories, but was significantly shorter by three amino acids in the mutated clones compared to the non-mutated clones. Analyses of the individual components that comprise CDR3 indicated that they were all shorter in the mutated clones.

We identified the respective suppressor mutations, T216I and R132T, which restored virus replication in a human T cell line and markedly enhanced the fitness of the original mutants as revealed in single-cycle infection assays. Analysis of the corresponding purified N-terminal domain CA proteins by NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the E45A and R132T mutations induced structural changes that are localized to the regions of the mutations, while the P38A mutation resulted in changes extending to neighboring regions in space. Unexpectedly, neither suppressor mutation corrected the intrinsic viral capsid stability defect associated with the respective original mutation. Nonetheless, the R132T mutation rescued the selective infectivity impairment exhibited by the E45A mutant in aphidicolin-arrested cells, and the double mutant regained sensitivity to the small molecule inhibitor PF74.

Structures of CA oligomers have been difficult to obtain because the subunit-subunit interactions are inherently weak, and CA tends to spontaneously assemble into capsid-like particles. Guided by a cryoEM-based model of the hexagonal lattice of HIV-1 CA, we used a two-step biochemical strategy to obtain soluble CA hexamers and pentamers for crystallization. First, each oligomer was stabilized by engineering disulfide cross-links between the N-terminal domains of adjacent subunits. Second, the cross-linked oligomers were prevented from polymerizing into hyperstable, capsid-like structures by mutations that weakened the dimeric association between the C-terminal domains that link adjacent oligomers. The X-ray structures revealed that the oligomers are comprised of a fairly rigid, central symmetric ring of N-terminal domains encircled by mobile C-terminal domains. Assembly of the quasi-equivalent oligomers requires remarkably subtle rearrangements in inter-subunit quaternary bonding interactions, and appears to be controlled by an electrostatic switch that favors hexamers over pentamers. An atomic model of the complete HIV-1 capsid was then built using the fullerene cone as a template. Rigid-body rotations around two assembly interfaces are sufficient to generate the full range of continuously varying lattice curvature in the fullerene cone. The steps in determining this HIV-1 capsid atomic model exemplify the synergy of hybrid methods in structural biology, a powerful approach for exploring the structure of pleomorphic macromolecular complexes.","author":" ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2011.04.073","matches":"mutation, x-ray, crystallography"},"21539734":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Anti-HIV Agents, Cell Line, Cloning, Molecular, Drug Design, Genetic Vectors, HIV-1, Humans, Hydrocarbons, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Microscopy, Confocal, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptides, Cyclic, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Secondary, Transfection, Virion, Virus Assembly, gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2011","title":"Antiviral activity of \u03b1-helical stapled peptides designed from the HIV-1 capsid dimerization domain.","abstract":"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of HIV-1 capsid (CA), like full-length CA, forms dimers in solution and CTD dimerization is a major driving force in Gag assembly and maturation.

Therefore, the CTD represents a potential target for designing anti-HIV-1 drugs.\n\nDue to the pivotal role of the dimer interface, we reasoned that peptides from the \u03b1-helical region of the dimer interface might be effective as decoys to prevent CTD dimer formation. However, these small peptides do not have any structure in solution and they do not penetrate cells. Therefore, we used the hydrocarbon stapling technique to stabilize the \u03b1-helical structure and confirmed by confocal microscopy that this modification also made these peptides cell-penetrating.

In in vitro assembly assays, the peptides inhibited mature-like virus particle formation and specifically inhibited HIV-1 production in cell-based assays. These peptides also showed potent antiviral activity against a large panel of laboratory-adapted and primary isolates, including viral strains resistant to inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and protease.\n\nThese preliminary data serve as the foundation for designing small, stable, \u03b1-helical peptides and small-molecule inhibitors targeted against the CTD dimer interface.

Although wild-type levels of membrane binding were restored to the M368A Gag by a second-site L20K mutation within matrix, the resultant Gag mutant L20K-M368A remained defective in virus production.

We suggest that these capsid shapes occur because the R18A mutation alters the frequency at which pentamers are incorporated into the hexagonal lattice. The fact that a single CA protein can simultaneously form all three known retroviral capsid morphologies supports the idea that these structures are organized on similar lattices and differ only in the distribution of 12 pentamers that allow them to close.

In murine leukemia virus (MLV) maturation, Gag is cleaved at three sites, resulting in formation of the matrix (MA), p12, capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins. We introduced mutations into MLV that inhibited cleavage at individual sites in Gag. All mutants had lost the intensely staining ring characteristic of immature particles; thus, no single cleavage event is required for this feature of maturation.

Particles in which p12 and CA could not be separated from each other were noninfectious and lacked a well-delineated core despite the presence of dense material in their interiors. In both of these mutants, the dimeric viral RNA had undergone the stabilization normally associated with maturation, suggesting that this change may depend upon the separation of CA from NC.

Neither protease nor integrase regions in Pol are required for its incorporation, implying an interaction between Gag and RT sequences in the Pol protein. While the incorporation of Gag-Pol into Gag VLPs is reduced 12-fold by the replacement of the nucleocapsid within Gag with a leucine zipper motif, this mutation does not affect Pol incorporation.

Finally, the identification of replication-defective mutants with normal viral assembly phenotypes indicates that CA also performs important nonstructural functions at early stages of the viral life cycle.","author":"von Schwedler UK","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12692245","matches":"mutation, alanine"},"12388733":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, COS Cells, Capsid, Dimerization, Gene Expression Regulation, Viral, Gene Products, gag, HIV-1, HeLa Cells, Humans, Jurkat Cells, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Peptides, Protein Structure, Secondary, Virion, Virus Assembly","date_submitted":"2002 Nov","title":"Characterization of a putative alpha-helix across the capsid-SP1 boundary that is critical for the multimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag.","abstract":"A 14-amino-acid spacer peptide termed SP1 that separates the capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) sequences plays an active role in the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This activity of SP1 involves its amino-terminal residues that, together with adjacent CA residues, constitute a putative alpha-helical structure spanning Gag residues from positions 359 to 371. In this study, we have determined that the virus assembly determinants within this putative alpha-helix were residues H359, K360, A361, L364, A367, and M368, of which K360 and A367 contribute to virus production to lesser extents. Notably, changes of the two basic amino acids H359 and K360 to arginine (R) impaired virus production, whereas mutations L364I and M368I, in contrast to L364A and M368A, generated near-wild-type levels of virus particles. This suggests that within Gag complexes, amino acids H359 and K360 are involved in stricter steric interactions than L364 and M368. Since L364 and M368 are separated by four residues and thus presumably located on the same side of the helical surface, they may initiate synergistic hydrophobic interactions to stabilize Gag association. Further analysis in the context of the protease-negative mutation D185H confirmed the key roles of amino acids H359, A361, L364, and M368 in virus assembly. Importantly, when transfected cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization and the cell lysates were treated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g, Gag molecules containing each of the H359A, A361V, L364A, and M368A mutations were found mainly in the supernatant fraction (S100), whereas approximately 80% of wild-type Gag proteins were found in the pellet.

Structural and sequence similarities among CA proteins of retroviruses and the CA-like proteins of hepatitis B virus and various retrotransposons suggest that the MHR is involved in an aspect of replication common to these reverse-transcribing elements. Conservative substitutions in this region of the Rous sarcoma virus protein were lethal due to a severe deficiency in reverse transcription, in spite of the presence of an intact genome and active reverse transcriptase in the particles. This finding suggests that the mutations interfered with normal interactions among these constituents. A total of four genetic suppressors of three lethal MHR mutations have now been identified. All four map to the sequence encoding the CA-spacer peptide (SP) region of Gag. The F167Y mutation in the MHR was fully suppressed by a single amino acid change in the alpha helix immediately downstream of the MHR, a region that forms the major dimer interface in human immunodeficiency virus CA. This finding suggests that the F167Y mutation indirectly interfered with dimerization. The F167Y defect could also be repaired by a second, independent suppressor in the C-terminal SP that was removed from CA during maturation. This single residue change, which increased the rate of SP cleavage, apparently corrected the F167Y defect by modifying the maturation pathway. More surprising was the isolation of suppressors of the R170Q and L171V MHR mutations, which mapped to the N-terminal domain of the CA protein.

Even when prevented from interacting with CyP A, Pr55Gag still forms particles that proceed to mature into morphologically wild-type virions, suggesting that CyP A influences a postassembly event. The nature of this CyP A influence has yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that while CyP A binds both Gag and mature CA proteins, the two binding interactions are actually different. <b>Tryptophan 121 (W121) in CyP A distinguished the two proteins: a phenylalanine substitution (W121F) impaired binding of mature CA protein but not of Gag<\/b>.

Consistent with this model, we found that recombinant capsid proteins with as few as four matrix residues fused to their amino-termini formed spheres in vitro, but that removing these residues refolded the capsid amino-terminus and redirected protein assembly from spheres to cylinders. Moreover, point mutations throughout the putative CA-CA interface blocked capsid assembly in vitro, core assembly in vivo and viral infectivity.

This unusual feature is analogous to bona fide camelid IgG in which modifications of Ig heavy chain V (VH) sequences prevent dimer formation with L chains. NAR also displays a uniquely flexible constant (C) region. Sequence analysis and modeling show that there are only two types of expressed NAR genes, each having different combinations of noncanonical cysteine (Cys) residues in the V domains that likely form disulfide bonds to stabilize the single antigen-recognition unit. In one NAR class, rearrangement events result in mature genes encoding an even number of Cys (two or four) in complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), which is analogous to Cys codon expression in an unusual human diversity (D) segment family. The NAR CDR3 Cys generally are encoded by preferred reading frames of rearranging D segments, providing a clear design for use of preferred reading frame in antigen receptor D regions. These unusual characteristics shared by NAR and unconventional mammalian Ig are most likely the result of convergent evolution at the molecular level.","author":"Roux KH","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9751746","matches":"mutation"}},"8848050":{"20335262":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Antibodies, Viral, Capsid Proteins, Cell Membrane, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Crystallization, Crystallography, X-Ray, Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments, Mice, Norovirus, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary","date_submitted":"2010 Jun","title":"High-resolution x-ray structure and functional analysis of the murine norovirus 1 capsid protein protruding domain.","abstract":"Murine noroviruses (MNV) are closely related to the human noroviruses (HuNoV), which cause the majority of nonbacterial gastroenteritis.

To begin a detailed investigation of molecular events that occur during norovirus binding to cells, the crystallographic structure of the murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) capsid protein protruding (P) domain has been determined. Crystallization of the bacterially expressed protein yielded two different crystal forms (Protein Data Bank identifiers [PDB ID], 3LQ6 and 3LQE). Comparison of the structures indicated a large degree of structural mobility in loops on the surface of the P2 subdomain. Specifically, the A'-B' and E'-F' loops were found in open and closed conformations. These regions of high mobility include the known escape mutation site for the neutralizing antibody A6.2 and an attenuation mutation site, which arose after serial passaging in culture and led to a loss in lethality in STAT1(-\/-) mice, respectively. Modeling of a Fab fragment and crystal structures of the P dimer into the cryoelectron microscopy three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction of the A6.2\/MNV-1 complex indicated that the closed conformation is most likely bound to the Fab fragment and that the antibody contact is localized to the A'-B' and E'-F' loops. Therefore, we hypothesize that these loop regions and the flexibility of the P domains play important roles during MNV-1 binding to the cell surface.","author":"Taube S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00316-10","matches":"mutation, x-ray, crystallography"},"20304924":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, COS Cells, Cercopithecus aethiops, Directed Molecular Evolution, Humans, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1, Mutation, Protein Engineering, Protein Folding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Saccharomyces cerevisiae","date_submitted":"2010 May 21","title":"Engineering of single Ig superfamily domain of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) for native fold and function.","abstract":"The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily is one of the largest families in the vertebrate genome, found most frequently in cell surface molecules. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) contains five extracellular Ig superfamily domains (D1-D5) of which the first domain, D1, is the binding site for the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and human rhinovirus. Despite the modular nature of many Ig superfamily domains with respect to domain folding and ligand recognition, D1 does not fold on its own due to the loss of its interaction with the second domain. The goal of this study was to engineer ICAM-1 D1 by introducing mutations that would stabilize the Ig superfamily domain fold while retaining its ability to bind to LFA-1 and rhinovirus. First, with a directed evolution approach, we isolated mutations in D1 that showed binding to conformation-specific antibodies and the ligand binding domain of LFA-1 called the inserted, or I, domain. Then, with a rational design approach we introduced mutations that contributed to the stability of ICAM-1 D1 in solution. The mutations that restored native folding of D1 in isolation were those that would convert hydrogen bond networks in buried regions into hydrophobic contacts. Notably, for most mutations, identical or similar types of substitutions were found in ICAM-1 molecules of different species and other ICAM family members. The systematic approach demonstrated in this study to engineer a single Ig superfamily fold in ICAM-1 can be broadly applicable to the engineering of modular Ig superfamily domains in other cell surface molecules.","author":"Owens RM","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M110.104349","matches":"mutation"},"19403680":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Antibodies, Viral, Capsid Proteins, Cell Line, Cross Reactions, Epitope Mapping, Humans, Molecular Sequence Data, Neutralization Tests, Picornaviridae Infections, Rabbits, Rhinovirus","date_submitted":"2009 Jul","title":"Antibodies to the buried N terminus of rhinovirus VP4 exhibit cross-serotypic neutralization.","abstract":"Development of a vaccine for the common cold has been thwarted by the fact that there are more than 100 serotypes of human rhinovirus (HRV). We previously demonstrated that the HRV14 capsid is dynamic and transiently displays the buried N termini of viral protein 1 (VP1) and VP4. Here, further evidence for this \"breathing\" phenomenon is presented, using antibodies to several peptides representing the N terminus of VP4. The antibodies form stable complexes with intact HRV14 virions and neutralize infectivity. Since this region of VP4 is highly conserved among all of the rhinoviruses, antiviral activity by these anti-VP4 antibodies is cross-serotypic. The antibodies inhibit HRV16 infectivity in a temperature- and time-dependent manner consistent with the breathing behavior. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against the 30-residue peptide do not react with peptides shorter than 24 residues, suggesting that these peptides are adopting three-dimensional conformations that are highly dependent upon the length of the peptide. Furthermore, there is evidence that the N termini of VP4 are interacting with each other upon extrusion from the capsid. A Ser5Cys mutation in VP4 yields an infectious virus that forms cysteine cross-links in VP4 when the virus is incubated at room temperature but not at 4 degrees C. The fact that all of the VP4s are involved in this cross-linking process strongly suggests that VP4 forms specific oligomers upon extrusion. Together these results suggest that it may be possible to develop a pan-serotypic peptide vaccine to HRV, but its design will likely require details about the oligomeric structure of the exposed termini.","author":"Katpally U","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00557-09","matches":"mutation"},"19011098":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Cell Fusion, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Crystallography, X-Ray, HeLa Cells, Humans, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutagenesis, Poliovirus, Protein Conformation, Receptors, Virus","date_submitted":"2008 Nov 25","title":"Crystal structure of CD155 and electron microscopic studies of its complexes with polioviruses.","abstract":"When poliovirus (PV) recognizes its receptor, CD155, the virus changes from a 160S to a 135S particle before releasing its genome into the cytoplasm.

Capsid stability plays an important role in the viral infection process, in that it needs to be stable enough to move from cell to cell and yet be able to release its genetic material upon the appropriate environmental cues from the host cell. It has been suggested that certain host cell molecules, \"pocket factors,\" bind to the WIN drug-binding cavity beneath the canyon floor and provide transient stability to a number of the picornaviruses. To directly test this hypothesis, HRV14 was mutated in (V1188M, C1199W, and V1188M\/C1199W) and around (S1223G) the drug-binding pocket. Infectivity, limited proteolysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analyses indicate that filling the drug-binding pocket with bulky side chains is not deleterious to the viral life cycle and lends some stabilization to the capsid. In contrast, studies with the S1223G mutant suggest that this mutation at least partially overcomes WIN drug-mediated inhibition of cell attachment and capsid breathing. Finally, HRV16, which is inherently more stable than HRV14 in a number of respects, was found to \"breathe\" only at 37 degrees C and did not tolerate stabilizing mutations in the drug-binding cavity. These results suggest that it is the drug-binding cavity itself and not the putative pocket factor that is crucial for the capsid dynamics, which is, in turn, necessary for infection.","author":"Katpally U","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00441-07","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"9557730":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antibodies, Viral, Crystallography, X-Ray, Humans, Models, Molecular, Neutralization Tests, Picornaviridae, Protein Conformation, Rhinovirus","date_submitted":"1998 May","title":"Structure of a neutralizing antibody bound monovalently to human rhinovirus 2.","abstract":"The structure of a complex between human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) and the Fab fragment of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3B10 has been determined to 25-A resolution by cryoelectron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques.

In the wild-type (WT) FvD1.3-HEL complex, the hydroxyl groups of VLTyr50, VHTyr32, and VHTyr101 each form at least one hydrogen bond with the lysozyme antigen. Thermodynamic parameters for antibody-antigen association have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry, giving equilibrium binding constants Kb (M-1) of 2.6 x 10(7) (VLY50S), 7.0 x 10(7) (VHY32A), and 4.0 x 10(6) (VHY101F).

In all three cases entropy compensation results in an affinity loss that would otherwise be larger. Comparison of the three mutant crystal structures with the WT structure demonstrates that the removal of direct antigen-antibody hydrogen bonds results in minimal shifts in the positions of the remaining protein atoms. These observations show that this complex is considerably tolerant, both structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody side chains that form hydrogen bonds with the antigen. Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes (VLY50S and VHY32A) appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when protein-protein interactions are removed. These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation. For the VHY101F complex, the nature of the large entropy compensation is not evident from a structural comparison of the WT and mutant complexes. Differences in the local structure and dynamics of the uncomplexed Fv molecules may account for the entropic discrepancy in this case.","author":"Fields BA","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi961709e","matches":"mutation, x-ray, crystallography, affinity"}},"9054968":{"19026659":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Drug Design, Epitopes, HIV Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp41, Humans, Models, Molecular, Protein Conformation, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Rhinovirus","date_submitted":"2009 Jan 16","title":"In silico vaccine design based on molecular simulations of rhinovirus chimeras presenting HIV-1 gp41 epitopes.","abstract":"A cluster of promising epitopes for the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines is located in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope spike structure.

Despite promising mechanistic proposals, so far, a physically consistent model that would reproduce all the relevant barriers needed to create a working pump has not been presented. In addition, there are major problems in elucidating the origin of key mutational effects and in understanding the nature of the apparent pK(a) values associated with the pH dependencies of specific proton transfer (PT) reactions in CcO. This work takes a key step in resolving the above problems, by considering mutations, such as the Asn139Asp replacement, that blocks proton pumping without affecting PT to the catalytic site. We first introduce a formulation that makes it possible to relate the apparent pK(a) of Glu286 to different conformational states of this residue. We then use the new formulation along with the calculated pK(a) values of Glu286 at these different conformations to reproduce the experimentally observed apparent pK(a) of the residue. Next, we take the X-ray structures of the native and Asn139Asp mutant of the Paracoccus denitrificans CcO (N131D in this system) and reproduce for the first time the change in the primary PT pathways (and other key features) based on simulations that start with the observed structural changes. We also consider the competition between proton transport to the catalytic site and the pump site, as a function of the bulk pH, as well as the H\/D isotope effect, and use this information to explore the relative height of the two barriers.

The D-channel is responsible for the uptake of all pumped protons, four protons per O(2). Several substitutions of either N139 or N207, near the entrance of the D-channel, were previously reported to decouple the proton pump from oxidase activity. In this work, the characteristics of additional mutations in this region of the protein (N139, N207, N121, and S142) are determined to elucidate the mechanism of decoupling. With the exception of the substitution of a large, hydrophobic residue (N139L), all the mutations of N139 resulted in an enzyme with high oxidase activity but with a severely diminished proton pumping stoichiometry. Whereas N207D was previously shown to be decoupled, N207A and N207T exhibit nearly wild-type behavior. The new data display a pattern. Small, nonionizable substitutions of N139 or N121 result in decoupling of the proton pump but maintain high turnover rates. These residues are directly hydrogen bonded to two water molecules (Water6574 and Water6584) that are part of the single-file chain of water molecules within the D-channel leading to E286 at the top of the channel. The data suggest that the integrity of this water chain within the D-channel is critical for rapid proton transfer. The mechanism of decoupling is most likely due to the slowing of the rate of proton delivery below a threshold that is required for protonation of the putative proton loading site. Protons delivered outside this time window are delivered to the active site where they are consumed in the formation of water. The rate of proton delivery required to protonate the pump site must be significantly faster than the rate of delivery of protons to the catalytic site. For this reason, mutations can result in decoupling of the proton pump without slowing the catalytic turnover by the enzyme.","author":"Zhu J","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi100344x","matches":"mutation"},"20307488":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Anaerobiosis, Bacterial Proteins, Base Sequence, DNA Primers, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy, Electron Transport, Electron Transport Complex IV, Heme, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Mutant Proteins, Oxidation-Reduction, Protons, Recombinant Proteins, Rhodobacter sphaeroides","date_submitted":"2010 Jun-Jul","title":"Blocking the K-pathway still allows rapid one-electron reduction of the binuclear center during the anaerobic reduction of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.","abstract":"The K-pathway is one of the two proton-input channels required for function of cytochrome c oxidase.

Mutations of conserved, polar residues within the K-channel block or inhibit steady state oxidase activity. A large body of research has demonstrated that the K-channel is required to fully reduce the heme\/Cu binuclear center, prior to the reaction with O2, presumably by providing protons to stabilize the reduced metals (ferrous heme a3 and cuprous CuB). However, there are conflicting reports which raise questions about whether blocking the K-channel blocks both electrons or only one electron from reaching the heme\/Cu center. In the current work, the rate and extent of the anaerobic reduction of the heme\/Cu center were monitored by optical and EPR spectroscopies, comparing the wild type and mutants that block the K-channel.

The results are consistent with an important role of R481 and heme a\/a(3) propionates in proton movement in a reversible exit path.","author":"Mills DA","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi050283d","matches":"mutation, energy"},"15454425":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Carbonic Anhydrase III, Computer Simulation, Electrochemistry, Energy Transfer, Enzyme Activation, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Models, Chemical, Models, Molecular, Motion, Protein Conformation, Proton Pumps, Protons, Static Electricity, Systems Biology, Water","date_submitted":"2004 Oct","title":"Studies of proton translocations in biological systems: simulating proton transport in carbonic anhydrase by EVB-based models.","abstract":"Proton transport (PTR) processes play a major role in bioenergetics and thus it is important to gain a molecular understanding of these processes. At present the detailed description of PTR in proteins is somewhat unclear and it is important to examine different models by using well-defined experimental systems. One of the best benchmarks is provided by carbonic anhydrase III (CA III), because this is one of the few systems where we have a clear molecular knowledge of the rate constant of the PTR process and its variation upon mutations. Furthermore, this system transfers a proton between several water molecules, thus making it highly relevant to a careful examination of the \"proton wire\" concept. Obtaining a correlation between the structure of this protein and the rate of the PTR process should help to discriminate between alternative models and to give useful clues about PTR processes in other systems. Obviously, obtaining such a correlation requires a correct representation of the \"chemistry\" of PTR between different donors and acceptors, as well as the ability to evaluate the free energy barriers of charge transfer in proteins, and to simulate long-time kinetic processes. The microscopic empirical valence bond (Warshel, A., and R. M. Weiss. 1980. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102:6218-6226; and Aqvist, J., and A. Warshel. 1993. Chem. Rev. 93:2523-2544) provides a powerful way for representing the chemistry and evaluating the free energy barriers, but it cannot be used with the currently available computer times in direct simulation of PTR with significant activation barriers. Alternatively, one can reduce the empirical valence bond (EVB) to the modified Marcus' relationship and use semimacroscopic electrostatic calculations plus a master equation to determine the PTR kinetics (Sham, Y., I. Muegge, and A. Warshel. 1999. Proteins. 36:484-500). However, such an approximation does not provide a rigorous multisite kinetic treatment. Here we combine the useful ingredients of both approaches and develop a simplified EVB effective potential that treats explicitly the chain of donors and acceptors while considering implicitly the rest of the protein\/solvent system. This approach can be used in Langevin dynamics simulations of long-time PTR processes. The validity of our new simplified approach is demonstrated first by comparing its Langevin dynamics results for a PTR along a chain of water molecules in water to the corresponding molecular dynamics simulations of the fully microscopic EVB model. This study examines dynamics of both models in cases of low activation barriers and the dependence of the rate on the energetics for cases with moderate barriers. The study of the dependence on the activation barrier is next extended to the range of higher barriers, demonstrating a clear correlation between the barrier height and the rate constant. The simplified EVB model is then examined in studies of the PTR in carbonic anhydrase III, where it reproduces the relevant experimental results without the use of any parameter that is specifically adjusted to fit the energetics or dynamics of the reaction in the protein. We also validate the conclusions obtained previously from the EVB-based modified Marcus' relationship. It is concluded that this approach and the EVB-based model provide a reliable, effective, and general tool for studies of PTR in proteins. <b>Finally in view of the behavior of the simulated result, in both water and the CA III, we conclude that the rate of PTR in proteins is determined by the electrostatic energy of the transferred proton as long as this energy is higher than a few kcal\/mol.<\/b>","author":"Braun-Sand S","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1529\/biophysj.104.043257","matches":"mutation, kcal, energy"},"15326290":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Azurin, Copper, Electron Transport, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Protein Engineering, Spectrophotometry","date_submitted":"2004 Aug 31","title":"pH-dependent transition between delocalized and trapped valence states of a CuA center and its possible role in proton-coupled electron transfer.","abstract":"A pH-dependent transition between delocalized and trapped mixed valence states of an engineered CuA center in azurin has been investigated by UV-visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques.

Upon lowering of the pH from 7.0 to 4.0, the absorption at 760 nm shifted to lower energy toward 810 nm, and a four-line EPR hyperfine, typical of a trapped valence, was observed. The pH-dependent transition is reversible because increasing the pH restores all delocalized spectral features. Lowering the pH resulted in not only a trapped valence state, but also a dramatically increased reduction potential of the Cu center (from 160 mV to 340 mV). Mutation of the titratable residues around the metal-binding site ruled out Glu-114 and identified the C-terminal histidine ligand (His-120) as a site of protonation, because the His120Ala mutation abolished the above pH-dependent transition. The corresponding histidine in cytochrome c oxidases is along a major electron transfer pathway from CuA center to heme a. Because the protonation of this histidine can result in an increased reduction potential that will prevent electron flow from the CuA to heme a, the CuA and the histidine may play an important role in regulating proton-coupled electron transfer.","author":"Hwang HJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0403473101","matches":"mutation, energy"},"15240445":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Computer Simulation, Cytochrome c Group, Electron Transport, Electron Transport Complex IV, Energy Metabolism, Horses, Lipid Bilayers, Membranes, Models, Molecular, Paracoccus denitrificans","date_submitted":"2004 Jul","title":"A Brownian dynamics study: the effect of a membrane environment on an electron transfer system.","abstract":"During the past few years, three-dimensional crystal structures of many of the important integral membrane proteins responsible for the bioenergetic processes of photosynthesis and respiration have been determined.

Here, we address the association kinetics for binding of cytochrome c to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) from Paracoccus denitrificans by Brownian dynamics simulations.

Interestingly, the presence of the lipid bilayer leads to a dramatic decrease of the association rate of horse heart cytochrome c, but slightly enhances association of cytochrome c(552), leading to very similar association rates of both proteins to membrane-embedded COX.

The question arises as to how water molecules behave inside and on the surface of a fluctuating membrane protein under more physiological conditions. Therefore, as an example, long-time molecular dynamics simulations of bacteriorhodopsin were performed with explicit membrane\/water environment. Based on a recent x-ray model the bacteriorhodopsin trimer was inserted in a fully solvated 16 x 16 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)-bilayer patch, resulting in a system of approximately 84,000 atoms.

Residues are identified which are H-bonded to the water clusters and are therefore facilitating proton conduction. Their influence on proton transfer via the H-bonded network as indicated by the continuum absorbance change is predicted.

An aspartate residue, Asp-51, located near the enzyme surface, undergoes a redox-coupled x-ray structural change, which is suggestive of a role for this residue in redox-driven proton pumping. However, functional or mechanistic evidence for the involvement of this residue in proton pumping has not yet been obtained. We report that the Asp-51 --> Asn mutation of the bovine enzyme abolishes its proton-pumping function without impairment of the dioxygen reduction activity. Improved x-ray structures (at 1.8\/1.9-A resolution in the fully oxidized\/reduced states) show that the net positive charge created upon oxidation of the low-spin heme of the enzyme drives the active proton transport from the interior of the mitochondria to Asp-51 across the enzyme via a water channel and a hydrogen-bond network, located in tandem, and that the enzyme reduction induces proton ejection from the aspartate to the mitochondrial exterior. A peptide bond in the hydrogen-bond network critically inhibits reverse proton transfer through the network. A redox-coupled change in the capacity of the water channel, induced by the hydroxyfarnesylethyl group of the low-spin heme, suggests that the channel functions as an effective proton-collecting region. Infrared results indicate that the conformation of Asp-51 is controlled only by the oxidation state of the low-spin heme.

Mutational inactivation of the proteolytic function of the matrix-localized Yta10p (Afg3p) AAA-protease partially stabilizes Cox2p in an mss2 mutant but does not restore assembly of cytochrome oxidase. In the absence of Mss2p, the Cox2p N terminus is exported, but Cox2p C-terminal export and assembly of Cox2p into cytochrome oxidase is blocked.

Single-electron reduction of the oxidized wild-type cytochrome c oxidase reveals two phases of membrane potential generation (tau(1) approximately 20 micros and tau(2) approximately 175 micros) at pH 7.4. The fast phase is not sensitive to cyanide and is assigned to electron transfer from Cu(A) to heme a. The slower phase is inhibited completely by cyanide and shows a kinetic deuterium isotope effect by a factor of 2-3.

This result suggests uptake of a proton through the K pathway during the transition from the oxidized to the one-electron reduced state. After the second laser flash under anaerobic conditions, a third electrogenic phase with a time constant of approximately 1 ms appears. The amplitude of this phase grows with increasing flash number. We explain this growth by injection of a second electron into the single-electron reduced enzyme. On multiple flashes, both D pathway mutants behave differently compared with the wild type and two additional slow phases of tau(3) approximately 2 ms and tau(4) approximately 15 ms are observed.

Recombinant TF extracellular domain supports adhesion of cells expressing alphavbeta3 or certain beta1 integrin heterodimers (alpha3beta1, alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, alpha6beta1, alpha9beta1) and adhesion is blocked by specific anti-integrin antibodies or mutations in the integrin ligand-binding site.

Expression of TF suppresses alpha3beta1-dependent migration, but only when the TF cytoplasmic domain is not phosphorylated. Suppression of migration can be reversed by 5G9, presumably by disrupting integrin interaction, or by the protease ligand VIIa, known to induce PAR-2-dependent phosphorylation of TF. In both cases, release of alpha3beta1 inhibition is prevented by mutation of critical phosphorylation sites in the TF cytoplasmic domain.

Such a phenomenon is not surprising when one considers that binding is a dynamic process with populations in equilibrium and that the shape of the binding site is strongly influenced by the molecular partner. It derives implicitly from the concept of populations. All proteins, specific and nonspecific, exist in ensembles of substates. If the library of ligands in solution is large enough, favorably matching ligands with altered shapes and sizes can be expected to bind, with a redistribution of the protein populations. Point mutations at spatially distant sites may exert large conformational rearrangements and hinge effects, consistent with mutations away from the binding site leading to population shifts and (cross-)drug resistance. A similar effect is observed in protein superfamilies, in which different sequences with similar topologies display similar large-scale dynamic motions. The hinges are frequently at analogous sites, yet with different substrate specificity. Similar topologies yield similar conformational isomers, although with different distributions of population times, owing to the change in the conditions, that is, the change in the sequences. In turn, different distributions relate to binding of different sizes and shapes. Hence, the binding site shape and size are defined by the ligand. They are not independent entities of fixed proportions and cannot be analyzed independently of the binding partner. Such a proposition derives from viewing proteins as dynamic distributions, presenting to the incoming ligands a range of binding site shapes. It illustrates how presumably specific binding molecules can bind multiple ligands. In terms of drug design, the ability of a single receptor to recognize many dissimilar ligands shows the need to consider more diverse molecules. It provides a rationale for higher affinity inhibitors that are not derived from substrates at their transition states and indicates flexible docking schemes.","author":"Ma B","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1110\/ps.21302","matches":"mutation, affinity"}},"9501911":{"19619477":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Blood Platelets, Calorimetry, Differential Scanning, Cell Adhesion, Humans, Membrane Glycoproteins, Membrane Proteins, Microscopy, Atomic Force, Models, Molecular, Mutation, Protein Binding, Protein Denaturation, Protein Stability, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Temperature, Thermodynamics, Urea, von Willebrand Factor","date_submitted":"2009 Jul 22","title":"Changes in thermodynamic stability of von Willebrand factor differentially affect the force-dependent binding to platelet GPIbalpha.","abstract":"In circulation, plasma glycoprotein von Willebrand Factor plays an important role in hemostasis and in pathological thrombosis under hydrodynamic forces.

Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the C-terminal region of TnrA identified three classes of mutants that altered the regulation by glutamine synthetase. While expression of the TnrA-regulated amtB gene was expressed constitutively in the class I (M96A, Q100A, and A103G) and class II (L97A, L101A, and F105A) mutants, the class II mutants were unable to grow on minimal medium unless a complex mixture of amino acids was present. The class III tnrA mutants (R93A, G99A, N102A, H104A, and Y107A mutants) were partially defective in the regulation of TnrA activity. In vitro experiments showed that feedback-inhibited glutamine synthetase had a significantly reduced ability to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of several class I and class II mutant TnrA proteins. A coiled-coil homology model of the C-terminal region of TnrA is used to explain the properties of the class I and II mutant proteins. The C-terminal region of TnrA corresponds to a dimerization domain in other MerR family proteins. Surprisingly, gel filtration and cross-linking analysis showed that a truncated TnrA protein which contained only the N-terminal DNA binding domain was dimeric. The implications of these results for the structure of TnrA are discussed.","author":"Wray LV","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JB.01238-06","matches":"alanine"},"16950393":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acid Substitution, Arginine, Binding Sites, Cell Cycle Proteins, Computer Simulation, Escherichia coli, Hydrogen Bonding, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, Molecular Structure, Mutation, Protein Binding, Proteins, Structure-Activity Relationship, Substrate Specificity, cdc25 Phosphatases","date_submitted":"2006 Oct 6","title":"The energetic network of hotspot residues between Cdc25B phosphatase and its protein substrate.","abstract":"We have investigated the functional network of hotspot residues at the remote docking site of two cell cycle regulators, namely Cdc25B phosphatase and its native protein substrate Cdk2-pTpY\/CycA.

Determination of the three-dimensional structure of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) b12 allowed modeling of the b12-gp120 interaction in which the protruding third complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the heavy chain (H3) was crucial for antibody binding. In the present study, extensive mutational analysis of the antigen-binding site of Fab b12 was carried out to investigate the validity of the model and to identify residues important for gp120 recognition and, by inference, key to the anti-HIV-1 activity of IgG1 b12. In all, 50 mutations were tested: 40 in H3, 4 each in H2 and L1, and 2 in L3. The results suggest that the interaction of gp120 with H3 of b12 is crucially dependent not only on a Trp residue at the apex of the H3 loop but also on a number of residues at the base of the loop. The arrangement of these residues, including aromatic side chains and side chains that hydrogen bond across the base of the loop, may rigidify H3 for penetration of the recessed CD4-binding cavity. The results further emphasize the importance to gp120 binding of a Tyr residue at the apex of the H2 loop that forms a second finger-like structure and a number of Arg residues in L1 that form a positively charged, shelf-like structure. In general, the data are consistent with the b12-gp120 interaction model previously proposed. At the gene level, somatic mutation is seen to be crucial for the generation of many of the structural features described. The Fab b12 mutants were also tested against the b12 epitope-mimic peptide B2.1, and the reactivity profile had many similarities but also significant differences from that observed for gp120.

Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin variable genes was analysed in clones of transgenic B cells proliferating in individual GCs in response to HEL or the cross-reactive low-affinity antigen, duck egg lysozyme (DEL). Molecular modelling of the antibody-antigen interface demonstrates that recurring mutations in the antigen-binding site, selected in GCs, enhance interactions of the antibody with DEL. The effects of these mutations on affinity maturation are demonstrated by a shift of transgenic serum antibodies towards higher affinity for DEL in DEL-cOVA immunized mice. The results show that B cells with high affinity antigen receptors can revise their specificity by somatic hypermutation and antigen selection in response to a low-affinity, cross-reactive antigen.

In this study we showed that breadth in CAP257 was largely due to the sequential, transient appearance of three distinct broadly neutralizing antibody specificities spanning the first 4.5 years of infection. The first specificity targeted an epitope in the V2 region of gp120 that was also recognized by strain-specific antibodies 7 weeks earlier. Specificity for the autologous virus was determined largely by a rare N167 antigenic variant of V2, with viral escape to the more common D167 immunotype coinciding with the development of the first wave of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Escape from these broadly neutralizing V2 antibodies through deletion of the glycan at N160 was associated with exposure of an epitope in the CD4 binding site that became the target for a second wave of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization by these CD4 binding site antibodies was almost entirely dependent on the glycan at position N276. Early viral escape mutations in the CD4 binding site drove an increase in wave two neutralization breadth, as this second wave of heterologous neutralization matured to recognize multiple immunotypes within this site. The third wave targeted a quaternary epitope that did not overlap any of the four known sites of vulnerability on the HIV-1 envelope and remains undefined.

The key targets for these neutralizing antibodies are the viral envelope antigens gp120 and gp41. Although broadly reactive neutralizing epitopes on gp120 and gp41 have been mapped and studied extensively, these epitopes are poorly immunogenic. Indeed, various vaccine candidates tested in preclinical and clinical trials do not generate antibodies against these epitopes. Hence, novel immunogen designs to augment the immunogenicity of these neutralizing epitopes are wanted. In this review, a unique immunogen design strategy that exploits immune complexes of gp120 and selected anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to elicit neutralizing antibodies against cross-reactive V3 epitopes is discussed. The ability of these complexes to stimulate neutralizing antibodies is dictated by fine specificity and affinity of mAbs used to form the complexes, indicating the contribution of Fab-mediated activity, rather than conventional Fc-mediated enhancement. Further improvement of V3 immunogenicity is attainable by forming immune complexes with gp120 mutants lacking site-specific N-linked glycans. The increased V3 immunogenicity on the mutated gp120\/mAb complexes correlates with enhancement of in vitro antibody recognition (antigenicity) and proteolytic resistance of V3 epitopes when presented on the complexes.

VRC06 and VRC06b neutralized 22% and 44% of viruses tested, respectively. Epitope mapping studies revealed that the two MAbs were sensitive to mutations in both the gp120 CoRbs and the CD4bs and could cross-block binding of both CD4bs and CoRbs MAbs to gp120. Fine mapping indicated contacts within the gp120 bridging sheet and the base of the third major variable region (V3), which are elements of the CoRbs. Cell surface binding assays demonstrated preferential recognition of fully cleaved Env trimers over uncleaved trimers. Thus, VRC06 and VRC06b are Env trimer precursor cleavage-sensitive neutralizing MAbs that bind to a region of gp120 that overlaps both the primary and the secondary HIV-1 receptor binding sites.","author":"Li Y","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.01543-12","matches":"mutation"},"22720026":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antibody Specificity, Epitope Mapping, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, Humans, Integrins, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Neutralization Tests, Protein Binding","date_submitted":"2012","title":"Monoclonal antibodies to the V2 domain of MN-rgp120: fine mapping of epitopes and inhibition of \u03b14\u03b27 binding.","abstract":"Recombinant gp120 (MN-rgp120) was a major component of the AIDSVAX B\/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial.

In all three subjects, initial Nab recognition was followed by sequential rounds of virus escape and Nab elicitation, with Nab escape variants exhibiting variable costs to replication fitness.

In this study, we examined the functional role of the polar segment and membrane proximal external region (MPER), which link the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain, respectively, to the core domain and interact to form a terminal clasp adjacent to the core. Limited proteolysis indicated that the terminal clasp is destabilized by simultaneous I535A\/V539G mutations within the polar segment and mutations within the MPER. The destabilizing effects of I535A\/V539G correlated with defective cell-cell fusion, viral entry, and viral replication. By using lipophilic and cytoplasmic fluorescent dye transfer assays, we found that terminal clasp destabilization is linked to a block in the lipid mixing\/hemifusion phase of the membrane fusion cascade. Because the biosynthesis of the prefusion gp120-gp41 complex did not appear to be affected by I535A\/V539G, we infer that the hemifusion block is due to a specific effect on the trimer of hairpins conformation of gp41. By contrast, the decreased fusion function of the MPER mutants correlated with a decrease in the interfacial hydropathy of the MPER sequence, suggesting that the prefusion Env complex had been adversely affected in these cases. These findings reveal a novel conserved functional target for the discovery of fusion inhibitors.","author":"Lay CS","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M111.299826","matches":"mutation"},"21945958":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antibodies, Neutralizing, Antibody Formation, Antibody Specificity, Antigen-Antibody Complex, Cell Proliferation, Cytokines, Epitopes, Female, HIV Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Infections, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neutralization Tests, Polysaccharides, T-Lymphocytes","date_submitted":"2011 Nov 8","title":"Improving immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope gp120 by glycan removal and immune complex formation.","abstract":"HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp120 is an important target for neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses against the virus; however, developing gp120 vaccines that elicit potent and broad neutralizing Abs has proven to be a formidable challenge. Previously, removal of an N-linked glycan at residue 448 by an N to Q mutation (N448Q) has been found to enhance the in vitro antigenicity of neutralizing epitopes in the V3 loop. In this study the mutated gp120 was first compared with wild type gp120 for immunogenicity in mice using a DNA prime and protein boost immunization regimen. The N448Q mutant did not elicit higher titers of anti-gp120 serum Abs and failed to generate anti-V3 Abs. The sera also had no virus-neutralizing activity, even though the mutant induced higher levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine production. Subsequently, the N448Q mutant was used to construct an immune complex vaccine with the anti-CD4 binding site monoclonal antibody (mAb) 654. The N448Q\/654 complex stimulated comparably high levels of serum Abs to gp120 and V3 as the wild type complex. However, Abs against the C1 and C2 regions in the gp120 core were more elevated. Importantly, the mutant complex also elicited higher titers of neutralizing Abs activity than the wild type counterpart. Similar results were achieved with a complex made with gp120 bearing an N448E mutation, confirming the importance of the N448-linked glycan in modulating gp120 immunogenicity. Neutralizing activity was directed to V3 and other undefined neutralizing epitopes. Improved immunogenicity of the immune complexes correlated with alterations in exposure of V3 and other Ab epitopes and their stability against proteases.

It has been suggested that envelope structural constraints in accommodating amino acid changes required for CXCR4 usage is an obstacle to tropism switch, limiting the rate and pathways available for HIV-1 coreceptor switching. The present study was initiated in two R5 SHIV(SF162P3N)-infected rapid progressor macaques with coreceptor switch to test the hypothesis that an early step in the evolution of tropism switch is the adoption of a less constrained and more \"open\" envelope conformation for better CD4 usage, allowing greater structural flexibility to accommodate further mutational changes that confer CXCR4 utilization. We show that, prior to the time of coreceptor switch, R5 viruses in both macaques evolved to become increasingly sCD4-sensitive, suggestive of enhanced exposure of the CD4 binding site and an \"open\" envelope conformation, and this correlated with better gp120 binding to CD4 and with more efficient infection of CD4(low) cells such as primary macrophages. Moreover, significant changes in neutralization sensitivity to agents and antibodies directed against functional domains of gp120 and gp41 were seen for R5 viruses close to the time of X4 emergence, consistent with global changes in envelope configuration and structural plasticity.

Ig Ms (IgMs) are on average significantly less divergent from germline antibodies and are relevant for the development of vaccine immunogens but are underexplored compared to IgGs. Here we describe the identification and characterization of several human IgM-derived mAbs against HIV-1 which were selected from a large phage-displayed naive human antibody library constructed from blood, lymph nodes and spleens of 59 healthy donors. These antibodies bound with high affinity to recombinant envelope glycoproteins (gp140s, Envs) of HIV-1 isolates from different clades. They enhanced or did not neutralize infection by some of the HIV-1 primary isolates using CCR5 as a coreceptor but neutralized all CXCR4 isolates tested although weakly. One of these antibodies with relatively low degree of somatic hypermutation was more extensively characterized. It bound to a highly conserved region partially overlapping with the coreceptor binding site and close to but not overlapping with the CD4 binding site. These results suggest the existence of conserved structures that could direct the immune response to non-neutralizing or even enhancing antibodies which may represent a strategy used by the virus to escape neutralizing immune responses. Further studies will show whether such a strategy plays a role in HIV infection of humans, how important that role could be, and what the mechanisms of infection enhancement are.

On the basis of this, a differential sorting of memory B cells was performed using gp120s made from 63-88C3 and CAP63 labeled with different fluorochromes as positive and negative probes, respectively.

Mutations that disturb the hot spot structure have significant effects on virus\/receptor interactions, revealing critical energy contributions from the hot spot structure. The tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV\/hACE2 interface is more compact than that at the SARS-CoV\/hACE2 interface, and hence RBD\/hACE2 binding affinities are decreased either by NL63-CoV mutations decreasing the tunnel space or by SARS-CoV mutations increasing the tunnel space. Furthermore, NL63-CoV RBD inhibits hACE2-dependent transduction by SARS-CoV spike protein, a successful application of the hot spot theory that has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV infections.

SPR analysis further showed that m18 inhibits interactions of gp120 with both soluble CD4 and CD4-induced antibodies that have epitopes overlapping the coreceptor binding site. This dual receptor site antagonism, which occurs with equal potency for both inhibition effects, argues that m18 is not functioning as a mimic of CD4, in spite of the presence of a putative CD4-like loop formed by HCDR3 in the antibody. Consistent with this view, m18 was found to interact with gp120 in the presence of saturating concentrations of a CD4-mimicking small molecule gp120 inhibitor, suggesting that m18 does not require unoccupied CD4 Phe43 binding cavity residues of gp120. Thermodynamic analysis of the m18-gp120 interaction suggests that m18 stabilizes a conformation of gp120 that is unique from and less structured than the CD4-stabilized conformation. Conformational mutants of gp120 were studied for their impact on m18 interaction. Mutations known to disrupt the coreceptor binding region and to lead to complete suppression of 17b binding had minimal effects on m18 binding. This argues that energetically important epitopes for m18 binding lie outside the disrupted bridging sheet region used for 17b and coreceptor binding. In contrast, mutations in the CD4 region strongly affected m18 binding. Overall, the results obtained in this work argue that m18, rather than mimicking CD4 directly, suppresses both receptor binding site functions of HIV-1 gp120 by stabilizing a nonproductive conformation of the envelope protein.

Here, we describe a virus with a rare mutation at position 179 in the V2 domain of gp120, where replacement of aspartic acid (D) by asparagine (N) converts a virus that is highly resistant to neutralization by multiple polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, as well as antiviral entry inhibitors, to one that is sensitive to neutralization. Although the V2 domain sequence is highly variable, D at position 179 is highly conserved in HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and is located within the LDI\/V recognition motif of the recently described \u03b14\u03b27 receptor binding site. Our results suggest that the D179N mutation induces a conformational change that exposes epitopes in both the gp120 and the gp41 portions of the envelope protein, such as the CD4 binding site and the MPER, that are normally concealed by conformational masking.

In this study, we describe a novel recombinant CD4 protein designed to bind gp120 through a targeted disulfide-exchange mechanism. According to structural models of the gp120-CD4 receptor complex, substitution of Ser(60) on the CD4 domain 1 alpha-helix with Cys positions a thiol in proximity of the gp120 V1\/V2 loop disulfide (Cys(126)-Cys(196)), satisfying the stereochemical and geometric conditions for redox exchange between CD4 Cys(60) and gp120 Cys(126), and the consequent formation of an interchain disulfide bond.

We analyzed viral and host determinants of resistance and their effects on viral tropism on primary CD4(+) T cells. The V3 loop contained residues essential for viral resistance to APL, while additional mutations in gp120 and gp41 modulated the magnitude of drug resistance.

The resistant virus displayed altered binding between gp120 and CCR5 such that the virus became critically dependent on the N' terminus of CCR5 in the presence of APL. In addition, the drug-resistant Envs studied here utilized CCR5 very efficiently: robust virus infection occurred even when very low levels of CCR5 were expressed. However, recognition of drug-bound CCR5 was less efficient, resulting in a tropism shift toward effector memory cells upon infection of primary CD4(+) T cells in the presence of APL, with relative sparing of the central memory CD4(+) T cell subset. If such a tropism shift proves to be a common feature of CCR5-antagonist-resistant viruses, then continued use of CCR5 antagonists even in the face of virologic failure could provide a relative degree of protection to the T(CM) subset of CD4(+) T cells and result in improved T cell homeostasis and immune function.","author":"Pfaff JM","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00374-10","matches":"mutation"},"20186035":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Antigens, CD4, Binding Sites, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Epitopes, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Neutralization Tests, Survivors","date_submitted":"2010 Mar 27","title":"Neutralization of genetically diverse HIV-1 strains by IgA antibodies to the gp120-CD4-binding site from long-term survivors of HIV infection.","abstract":"To identify an HIV epitope suitable for vaccine development.\n\nDiverse HIV-1 strains express few structurally constant regions on their surface vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies.

Early nAb responses were very restricted, occurring sequentially and targeting only two regions of the envelope. In V1V2, limited amino acid changes often involving indels or glycans, mediated partial or complete escape, with nAbs targeting the V1V2 region directly in 2 cases. The alpha-2 helix of C3 was also a nAb target, with neutralization escape associated with changes to positively charged residues. In one individual, relatively high titers of anti-C3 nAbs were required to drive genetic escape, taking up to 7 weeks for the resistant variant to predominate. Thereafter titers waned but were still measurable. Development of this single anti-C3 nAb specificity was associated with a 7-fold drop in HIV-1 viral load and a 4-fold rebound as the escape mutation emerged.

To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus's ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.","author":"Rong R","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000594","matches":"mutation"},"19726674":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Amino Acid Substitution, Animals, Antigens, CD4, Crystallography, X-Ray, Epitope Mapping, Epitopes, HIV Antibodies, Humans, Immunoglobulin Fragments, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Neutralization Tests, Protein Conformation","date_submitted":"2009 Oct 30","title":"Toward effective HIV vaccination: induction of binary epitope reactive antibodies with broad HIV neutralizing activity.","abstract":"We describe murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised by immunization with an electrophilic gp120 analog (E-gp120) expressing the rare ability to neutralize genetically heterologous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains.

AB also efficiently prevents fusion between persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78 cells and uninfected (CD4(+)) lymphocytes, DC-SIGN-directed HIV-1 capture, and subsequent transmission to uninfected (CD4(+)) T lymphocytes. Prolonged passaging of HIV-1 at dose-escalating concentrations of AB resulted in the selection of mutant virus strains in which several N-glycans of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope were deleted and in which positively charged amino acid mutations in both gp120 and gp41 appeared. A mutant virus strain in which four N-glycans were deleted showed a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of AB.

The adapted virus, termed TA1, retained the V3 truncation, was exquisitely sensitive to neutralization by the CD4 binding site monoclonal antibody b12 and by HIV-positive human sera, used CCR5 to enter cells, and was completely resistant to small molecule CCR5 antagonists. To examine the mechanistic basis for these properties, we singly and in combination introduced each of the 5 mutations from the adapted clone TA1 into the unadapted envelope. We found that single amino acid changes in the C3 region, the V3 loop, and in the fusion peptide were responsible for imparting near-normal levels of envelope function to TA1. T342A, which resulted in the loss of a highly conserved glycosylation site in C3, played the primary role. The adaptive amino acid changes had no impact on CCR5 antagonist resistance but made virus more sensitive to neutralization by antibodies to the CD4 binding site, modestly enhanced affinity for CD4, and made TA1 more responsive to CD4 binding. Specifically, TA1 was triggered by soluble CD4 more readily than the parental Env and, unlike the parental Env, could mediate entry on cells that express low levels of CD4. In contrast, TA1 interacted with CCR5 less efficiently and was highly sensitive to antibodies that bind to the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2. Therefore, enhanced utilization of CD4 is one mechanism by which HIV-1 can overcome mutations in the V3 region that negatively affect CCR5 interactions.","author":"Agrawal-Gamse C","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.01238-09","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"19671162":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Cell Fusion, Genes, Reporter, Genetic Complementation Test, Genetic Vectors, HIV-1, Humans, Mutant Proteins, Mutation, Missense, Protein Multimerization, Protein Subunits, Sequence Deletion, Vaccinia virus, Virus Internalization, env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus","date_submitted":"2009","title":"Complementation of diverse HIV-1 Env defects through cooperative subunit interactions: a general property of the functional trimer.","abstract":"The HIV-1 Env glycoprotein mediates virus entry by catalyzing direct fusion between the virion membrane and the target cell plasma membrane. Env is composed of two subunits: gp120, which binds to CD4 and the coreceptor, and gp41, which is triggered upon coreceptor binding to promote the membrane fusion reaction. Env on the surface of infected cells is a trimer consisting of three gp120\/gp41 homo-dimeric protomers. An emerging question concerns cooperative interactions between the protomers in the trimer, and possible implications for Env function.\n\nWe extended studies on cooperative subunit interactions within the HIV-1 Env trimer, using analysis of functional complementation between coexpressed inactive variants harboring different functional deficiencies. In assays of Env-mediated cell fusion, complementation was observed between variants with a wide range of defects in both the gp120 and gp41 subunits. The former included gp120 subunits mutated in the CD4 binding site or incapable of coreceptor interaction due either to mismatched specificity or V3 loop mutation. Defective gp41 variants included point mutations at different residues within the fusion peptide or heptad repeat regions, as well as constructs with modifications or deletions of the membrane proximal tryptophan-rich region or the transmembrane domain. Complementation required the defective variants to be coexpressed in the same cell. The observed complementation activities were highly dependent on the assay system. The most robust activities were obtained with a vaccinia virus-based expression and reporter gene activation assay for cell fusion. In an alternative system involving Env expression from integrated provirus, complementation was detected in cell fusion assays, but not in virus particle entry assays.\n\nOur results indicate that Env function does not require every subunit in the trimer to be competent for all essential activities. Through cross-talk between subunits, the functional determinants on one defective protomer can cooperatively interact to trigger the functional determinants on an adjacent protomer(s) harboring a different defect, leading to fusion. Cooperative subunit interaction is a general feature of the Env trimer, based on complementation activities observed for a highly diverse range of functional defects.","author":"Salzwedel K","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1742-4690-6-75","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"19605489":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cell Line, Cloning, Molecular, HIV-1, Humans, Kinetics, Luciferases, Macaca, Molecular Sequence Data, Phenotype, Plasmids, Receptors, CXCR4, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Simian immunodeficiency virus","date_submitted":"2009 Oct","title":"Derivation and characterization of a simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 variant with tropism for CXCR4.","abstract":"Like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), most simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains use CCR5 to establish infection. However, while HIV-1 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4, SIVs that utilize CXCR4 have rarely been reported. To explore possible barriers against SIV coreceptor switching, we derived an R5X4 variant, termed 239-ST1, from the R5 clone SIVmac239 by serially passaging virus in CD4(+) CXCR4(+) CCR5(-) SupT1 cells. A 239-ST1 env clone, designated 239-ST1.2-32, used CXCR4 and CCR5 in cell-cell fusion and reporter virus infection assays and conferred the ability for rapid, cytopathic infection of SupT1 cells to SIVmac239. Viral replication was inhibitable by the CXCR4-specific antagonist AMD3100, and replication was abrogated in a novel CXCR4(-) SupT1 line. Surprisingly, parental SIVmac239 exhibited low-level replication in SupT1 cells that was not observed in CXCR4(-) SupT1 cells. Only two mutations in the 239-ST1.2-32 Env, K47E in the C1 domain and L328W in the V3 loop, were required for CXCR4 use in cell-cell fusion assays, although two other V3 changes, N316K and I324M, improved CXCR4 use in infection assays. An Env cytoplasmic tail truncation, acquired during propagation of 239-ST1 in SupT1 cells, was not required. Compared with SIVmac239, 239-ST1.2-32 was more sensitive to neutralization by five of seven serum and plasma samples from SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques and was approximately 50-fold more sensitive to soluble CD4. Thus, SIVmac239 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4 with high efficiency, but the changes required for this phenotype may be distinct from those for HIV-1 CXCR4 use. This finding, along with the increased neutralization sensitivity of this CXCR4-using SIV, suggests a mechanism that could select strongly against this phenotype in vivo.","author":"Del Prete GQ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00533-09","matches":"mutation"},"19570853":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antibodies, Viral, Antigens, CD4, Cell Line, Drug Resistance, Viral, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV-1, Humans, Mutation, Receptors, HIV, Recombinant Proteins, Sulfonamides, Virus Internalization","date_submitted":"2009 Sep","title":"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 escape from cyclotriazadisulfonamide-induced CD4-targeted entry inhibition is associated with increased neutralizing antibody susceptibility.","abstract":"Continuous specific downmodulation of CD4 receptor expression in T lymphocytes by the small molecule cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA) selected for the CADA-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) NL4.3 virus containing unique mutations in the C4 and V5 regions of gp120, likely stabilizing the CD4-binding conformation.

Finally, cross-antagonism assays showed that Delta9-12a could use aplaviroc-bound CCR5 for entry.

Three mutants tested showed enhanced sensitivity to soluble CD4. Mutant N7 (N197Q) in the carboxy-terminal stem of the V2 loop showed the most pronounced increase in sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs), including those targeting the CD4-binding site (IgG1b12) and the V3 loop (447-52D). This mutant is also sensitive to CD4-induced NtAb 17b in the absence of CD4. Unlike the wild-type (WT) Env, mutant N7 mediates CD4-independent infection in U87-CXCR4 cells. To study the immunogenicity of mutant Env, we immunized pig-tailed macaques with recombinant vaccinia viruses, one expressing SIVmac239 Gag-Pol and the other expressing HIV-1 89.6 Env gp160 in WT or mutant forms. Animals were boosted 14 to 16 months later with simian immunodeficiency virus gag DNA and the cognate gp140 protein before intrarectal challenge with SHIV89.6P-MN. Day-of-challenge sera from animals immunized with mutant N7 Env had significantly higher and broader neutralizing activities than sera from WT Env-immunized animals. Neutralizing activity was observed against SHIV89.6, SHIV89.6P-MN, HIV-1 SF162, and a panel of subtype B primary isolates. Compared to control animals, immunized animals showed significant reduction of plasma viral load and increased survival after challenge, which correlated with prechallenge NtAb titers.

In this study, we have found that two BA entry inhibitors, IC9564 and A43D, exhibited a broad spectrum of anti-HIV-1 activity. Both compounds inhibited multiple strains of HIV-1 from clades A, B, and C at submicromolar concentrations. Clade C viruses were more sensitive to the compounds than clade A and B viruses.

IC9564 was especially potent in increasing the sensitivity of HIV-1 YU2 Env-mediated membrane fusion to the CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779.

We previously isolated adapted HIV-1(JRCSF) variants that more efficiently use mutant CCR5s, including CCR5(Delta18) lacking the important tyrosine sulfate-containing amino terminus. Effects of mutant CCR5 concentrations on HIV-1 infectivities were highly cooperative, implying that several may be required. However, because wild-type CCR5 efficiently mediates infections at trace concentrations that were difficult to measure accurately, analyses of its cooperativity were not feasible. New HIV-1(JRCSF) variants efficiently use CCR5(HHMH), a chimera containing murine extracellular loop 2. The adapted virus induces large syncytia in cells containing either wild-type or mutant CCR5s and has multiple gp120 mutations that occurred independently in CCR5(Delta18)-adapted virus. Accordingly, these variants interchangeably use CCR5(HHMH) or CCR5(Delta18). Additional analyses strongly support a novel energetic model for allosteric proteins, implying that the adaptive mutations reduce quaternary constraints holding gp41, thus lowering the activation energy barrier for membrane fusion without affecting bonds to specific CCR5 sites. In accordance with this mechanism, highly adapted HIV-1s require only one associated CCR5(HHMH), whereas poorly adapted viruses require several. However, because they are allosteric ensembles, complexes with additional co-receptors fuse more rapidly and efficiently than minimal ones. Similarly, wild-type HIV-1(JRCSF) is highly adapted to wild-type CCR5 and minimally requires one. The adaptive mutations cause resistances to diverse entry inhibitors and cluster appropriately in the gp120 trimer interface overlying gp41. We conclude that membrane fusion complexes are allosteric machines with an ensemble of compositions, and that HIV-1 adapts to entry limitations by gp120 mutations that reduce its allosteric hold on gp41. These results provide an important foundation for understanding the mechanisms that control membrane fusion and HIV-1's facile adaptability.","author":"Platt EJ","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2007.09.016","matches":"mutation, energy"},"17855534":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Animals, Antibodies, Viral, Cell Line, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Envelope Protein gp160, HIV-1, Humans, Macaca, Mutation, Missense, Neutralization Tests, Protein Processing, Post-Translational","date_submitted":"2007 Dec","title":"Mutations in envelope gp120 can impact proteolytic processing of the gp160 precursor and thereby affect neutralization sensitivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pseudoviruses.","abstract":"The design of an efficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunogen able to generate broad neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) remains an elusive goal. As more data emerge, it is becoming apparent that one important aspect of such an immunogen will be the proper representation of the envelope protein (Env) as it exists on native virions. Important questions that are yet to be fully addressed include what factors dictate Env processing, how different Env forms are represented on the virion, and ultimately how these issues influence the development and efficacy of NAbs. Recent data have begun to illuminate the extent to which changes in gp41 can impact the overall structure and neutralizing sensitivity of Env. Here, we present evidence to suggest that minor mutations in gp120 can significantly impact Env processing. We analyzed the gp120 sequences of 20 env variants that evolved in multiple macaques over 8 months of infection with simian\/human immunodeficiency virus 89.6P. Variant gp120 sequences were subcloned into gp160 expression plasmids with identical cleavage motifs and gp41 sequences. Cells cotransfected with these plasmids and delta env genomes were able to produce competent virus. The resulting pseudoviruses incorporated high levels of Env onto virions that exhibited a range of degrees of virion-associated Env cleavage (15 to 40%). Higher levels of cleavage correlated with increased infectivity and increased resistance to macaque plasma, HIV immunoglobulin, soluble CD4, and human monoclonal antibodies 4E10, 2F5, and b12.

Two sites within each variable loop of SIV239 were chosen for individual epitope tag insertions. FLAG epitope substitutions were also made in the V1, V2, and V4 loops of a neutralization-sensitive derivative of SIV239, SIV316. Of the 10 FLAG-tagged recombinant viruses analyzed, three (SIV239FV1b, SIV239FV2b, and SIV239FV4a) replicated with kinetics similar to those of the parental strain, SIV239, in both CEMx174 cells and the immortalized rhesus monkey T-cell line 221. The SIV316FV1b and SIV316FV4a FLAG variants replicated with a substantial lag, and the five remaining recombinants did not replicate detectably. Both gp160 and gp120 from replication-competent FLAG variants could be immunoprecipitated from transfected 293T cells by the anti-gp120 rhesus monoclonal antibody (RhMAb) 3.11H, the anti-FLAG MAb M2, and CD4-immunoglobulin, whereas only unprocessed gp160 was detected in 293T cells transfected with replication-defective variants.

Neither SIV239FV2b nor SIV239FV4a was sensitive to M2 neutralization. The ability of the M2 antibody to neutralize SIV239FV1b infectivity was associated with an increased ability of the M2 antibody to detect native, oligomeric SIV239FV1b envelope protein on the surfaces of cells relative to that for the other SIV FLAG variants. Furthermore, SIV239FV1b was globally more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization than was parental SIV239 when these strains were screened with a panel of anti-SIV MAbs of various specificities. These results indicate that the V1 loop can serve as an effective target for neutralization on SIV239FV1b. However, antibody-mediated neutralization of this variant, similar to that of other SIV239 variants that have been studied previously, was associated with a global increase in neutralization sensitivity.

The rate of fusion with target cells expressing wild-type CCR5 and the resistance to fusion inhibitors was virtually identical for wild-type Env and Env(NYP), implying that the coreceptor affinity had not increased as a result of adaptation. In contrast, Env(NYP)-induced fusion with cells expressing CCR5(Delta 18) occurred at a slower rate and was extremely sensitive to the CCR5 binding inhibitor, Sch-C. Resistance to Sch-C drastically increased after pre-incubation of Env(NYP)- and CCR5(Delta 18)-expressing cells at a temperature that was not permissive to fusion. This indicates that ternary Env(NYP)-CD4-CCR5(Delta 18) complexes accumulate at sub-threshold temperature and that low-affinity interactions with the truncated coreceptor are sufficient for triggering conformational changes in the gp41 of Env(NYP) but not in wild-type Env. We also demonstrated that the ability of CCR5(Delta 18) to support fusion and infection mediated by wild-type Env can be partially reconstituted in the presence of a synthetic sulfated peptide corresponding to the CCR5 Nt.

Nevertheless, exchange of the entire alpha2 helix between resistant donor Envs and sensitive recipient Envs did not alter the NAb phenotype. The combined mutual information and dN\/dS analyses suggest that unique mutational patterns in alpha2 and insertions in the V1-to-V4 region are associated with NAb resistance during subtype C infection but that the selected positions within the alpha2 helix must be linked to still other changes in Env to confer antibody escape. These findings suggest that subtype C viruses utilize mutations in the alpha2 helix for efficient viral replication and immune avoidance.","author":"Rong R","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.00257-07","matches":"mutation"},"17320250":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"AIDS Vaccines, Animals, Cytokines, Female, Gene Products, env, HIV Antibodies, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Immunity, Cellular, Immunization, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mutation, Neutralization Tests, Simian immunodeficiency virus, Virion","date_submitted":"2007 May 10","title":"Immunogenicity of virus-like particles containing modified human immunodeficiency virus envelope proteins.","abstract":"Extensive glycosylation and variable loops of the HIV envelope protein (Env) are reported to shield some neutralizing epitopes.

Identifying instances of positive selection is a difficult task, because its impact is routinely obscured by the action of negative selection. The nature of the genetic code dictates that positive selection in favor of an amino acid replacement should often cause a burst of two or three nucleotide substitutions at a single codon site, because a large fraction of amino acid replacements cannot be achieved after just one nucleotide substitution. Here, we study pairs of successive nonsynonymous substitutions at one codon in the course of evolution of HIV-1 genes within HIV-1 populations inhabiting infected individuals. Such pairs are more numerous and more clumped than expected if different substitutions were independent and than what is observed for pairs of successive synonymous substitutions. Bursts of nonsynonymous substitutions in HIV-1 evolution cannot be explained by mutational biases and must, therefore, be due to positive selection. Both reversals, exact or imprecise, of fixed deleterious mutations and acquisitions of amino acids with new properties are responsible for the bursts. Temporal clumping is strongest at codon sites with a low overall rate of nonsynonymous evolution, implying that a substantial fraction of replacements of conservative amino acids are driven by positive selection.

The fusion inhibitor T20 targets the viral envelope (Env) protein by blocking a conformational switch that is critical for viral entry into the host cell. T20-dependent viral entry is the result of 2 mutations in Env (GIA-SKY), creating a protein that undergoes a premature conformational switch, and the presence of T20 prevents this premature switch and rescues viral entry.

The GIA-SKY-G431R escape variant produces an Env protein that exhibits reduced syncytia formation and reduced cell-cell fusion activity. The escape variant was more sensitive to an antibody acting on an early gp41 intermediate, suggesting that the G431R mutation helps preserve a pre-fusion Env conformation, similar to T20 action. The escape variant was also less sensitive to soluble CD4, suggesting a reduced CD4 receptor affinity.\n\nThe forced evolution experiments indicate that the premature conformational switch of the T20-dependent HIV-1 Env variant (GIA-SKY) can be corrected by a second site mutation in Env (GIA-SKY-G431R) that affects the interaction with the CD4 receptor.","author":"Baldwin CE","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1742-4690-3-84","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"17101166":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cell Fusion, Cell Line, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptide Fragments, Point Mutation, Protein Binding, Receptors, CCR5","date_submitted":"2007 Mar 30","title":"Mutations in the V3 stem versus the V3 crown and C4 region have different effects on the binding and fusion steps of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 interaction with the CCR5 coreceptor.","abstract":"The current model for HIV-1 envelope-coreceptor interaction depicts the V3 stem and bridging sheet binding to the CCR5 N-terminus while the V3 crown interacts with the second extracellular loop, which is the coreceptor domain that appears to be relatively more important for fusion and infection.

Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands.

When HIV-1-infected CEM cell cultures were exposed to CV-N in a dose-escalating manner, a total of eight different amino acid mutations exclusively located at N-glycosylation sites in the envelope surface gp120 were observed. Six of the eight mutations resulted in the deletion of high-mannose type N-glycans (i.e., at amino acid positions 230, 332, 339, 386, 392, and 448). Two mutations (i.e., at position 136 and 160) deleted a complex type N-glycan in the variable V1\/V2 domain of gp120. The level of phenotypic resistance of the mutated virus strains against CV-N generally correlated with the number of glycan deletions in gp120, although deletion of the glycans at N-230, N-392, and N-448 generally afforded a more pronounced CV-N resistance than other N-glycan deletions.

This is in agreement with a more consistent suppression of a wider variety of HIV-1 clades by CV-N than by HHA and GNA.

The truncating mutation increased Env content in virions, increased infectivity, and decreased sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization in both strains. However, the magnitude of the effect on infectivity and neutralization sensitivity differed considerably between the two strains. In the context of strain SIV239-M5, truncation increased Env content in virions approximately 10-fold and infectivity in a reporter cell assay 24-fold. The truncated SIV239-M5 was only slightly more resistant to neutralization by polyclonal monkey sera and by monoclonal antibodies than SIV239-M5 with a full-length envelope glycoprotein. In the context of strain SIV316, truncation increased infectivity a dramatic 480-fold, while envelope content in virions was increased only about 14-fold. This dramatic increase in infectivity cannot be simply explained by the increase in envelope content and is likely due to an increase in inherent infectivity, i.e., infectivity per spike, that results from truncation. The truncated SIV316 was extremely resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization. In fact, it was not neutralized by any of the antibodies tested. When increasing amounts of SIV316 envelope glycoprotein (full length) were provided in trans to SIV316, infectivity was increased and sensitivity to neutralization was decreased, but to nowhere near the degree that was obtained when truncated SIV316 envelope glycoprotein was used. Truncated forms of SIV239 and SIV239-M5 required higher levels of soluble CD4 for inhibition of infection than their nontruncated forms; truncated SIV316 did not. Our results suggest that envelope content in SIV virions, infectivity, and resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization can be increased not only by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain but also by provision of excess envelope in trans. The striking increase in infectivity that results from truncation in the context of SIV316 appears to be due principally to an increase in inherent infectivity per spike.","author":"Yuste E","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.79.19.12455-12463.2005","matches":"mutation"},"15919930":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Anti-HIV Agents, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Bacterial Proteins, Carrier Proteins, Cell Line, Concanavalin A, Drug Resistance, Viral, Glycosylation, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Envelope Protein gp160, HIV-1, Humans, Mannose, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Models, Molecular, Mutation","date_submitted":"2005 Jun","title":"Resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to the high-mannose binding agents cyanovirin N and concanavalin A.","abstract":"Due to the biological significance of the carbohydrate component of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) glycoproteins in viral pathogenesis, the glycosylation step constitutes an attractive target for anti-HIV therapy. Cyanovirin N (CV-N), which specifically targets the high-mannose (HM) glycans on gp120, has been identified as a potent HIV-1 entry inhibitor. Concanavalin A (ConA) represents another mannose-binding lectin, although it has a lower specificity for HM glycans than that of CV-N. For the present study, we selected CV-N- and ConA-resistant HIV-1 strains in the presence of CV-N and ConA, respectively. Both resistant strains exhibited a variety of mutations eliminating N-linked glycans within gp120. Strains resistant to CV-N or ConA displayed high levels of cross-resistance towards one another. The N-glycan at position 302 was eliminated in both of the lectin-resistant strains. However, the elimination of this glycan alone by site-directed mutagenesis was not sufficient to render HIV-1 resistant to CV-N or ConA, suggesting that HIV-1 needs to mutate several N-glycans to become resistant to these lectins. Both strains also demonstrated clear cross-resistance towards the carbohydrate-dependent monoclonal antibody 2G12. In contrast, the selected strains did not show a reduced susceptibility towards the nonlectin entry inhibitors AMD3100 and enfuvirtide or towards reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors. Recombination of the mutated gp160 genes of the strains resistant to CV-N or ConA into a wild-type background fully reproduced the (cross-)resistance profiles of the originally selected strains, pointing to the impact of the N-glycan mutations on the phenotypic resistance profiles of both selected strains.","author":"Witvrouw M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.79.12.7777-7784.2005","matches":"mutation, mutate"},"15890910":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Binding Sites, Bovine papillomavirus 1, COS Cells, Capsid Proteins, Cattle, Cell Line, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Humans, Membrane Proteins, Microscopy, Electron, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Papillomavirus Infections, Protein Binding, Qa-SNARE Proteins, Recombinant Proteins, Transfection, Virulence, Virus Assembly","date_submitted":"2005 Jun","title":"Interaction of tSNARE syntaxin 18 with the papillomavirus minor capsid protein mediates infection.","abstract":"The papillomavirus capsid mediates binding to the cell surface and passage of the virion to the perinuclear region during infection.

These previously isolated HIV-1(JR-CSF) variants contained adaptive mutations situated exclusively in the V3 loop of their gp120 envelope glycoproteins. We now have weaned the virus from all dependency on the CCR5 amino terminus by performing additional selections with HeLa-CD4 cells that express only a low concentration of CCR5(Delta18). The adapted variants had additional mutations in their V3 loops, as well as one in the V2 stem (S193N) and four alternative mutations in the V4 loop that eliminated the same N-linked oligosaccharide from position N403. Assays using pseudotyped viruses suggested that these new gp120 mutations all made strong contributions to use of CCR5(Delta18) by accelerating a rate-limiting CCR5-dependent conformational change in gp41 rather than by increasing viral affinity for this damaged coreceptor. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of the V4 N-glycan at position N403 also enhanced HIV-1 use of a different low-affinity CCR5 coreceptor with a mutation in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) [i.e., CCR5(G163R)], whereas the double mutant CCR5(Delta18,G163R) was inactive. We conclude that loss of the N-glycan at position N403 helps to convert the HIV-1 envelope into a hair-trigger form that no longer requires strong interactions with both the CCR5 amino terminus and ECL2 but efficiently uses either site alone.

Although the epitope maps of the MAbs overlapped, a number of key differences between b12 and the other two antibodies were observed. These differences may explain why b12, in contrast to nonneutralizing antibodies, is able to interact not only with monomeric gp120 but also with functional oligomeric gp120 at the virion surface. <b>Neutralization assays performed with pseudovirions bearing envelopes from a selection of alanine mutants mostly showed a reasonable correlation between the effects of the mutations on b12 binding to monomeric gp120 and neutralization efficacy<\/b>.

Mutations in the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of gp120 and the carboxy terminus of gp41 contributed to the neutralization resistance, high-infectivity phenotype but depended upon sequences in the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of gp41.

Mutations that distinguished the gp120s of MN-P and MN-TCLA clones were clustered in or near the CD4 and coreceptor binding sites and in regions distant from those binding sites. To test the hypothesis that some of these distant mutations may interact with gp41, we determined which of them contributed to high infectivity and whether those mutations modulated gp120-gp41 association in the context of MN-P LZ sequences. In one clone, six mutations in the amino terminus of gp120, at least four of which clustered closely on the inner domain, modulated infectivity. This clone had a gp120-gp41 association phenotype like MN-P: in comparison to MN-TCLA, spontaneous dissociation was low, and dissociation induced by soluble CD4 binding was high.

Here, we formally demonstrate that gp120 binding to DC-SIGN and MDDCs is largely if not wholly carbohydrate dependent. Endo-beta-N-glucosaminidase H (EndoH) treatment of gp120-Fc under conditions that maintained wild-type CD4 binding-and the full complement of complex glycans-significantly decreased (>90%) binding to DC-SIGN expressing cell lines, as well as to MDDCs. Any residual binding of EndoH-treated gp120-Fc to DC-SIGN was completely competed off with mannan. Mutational analysis indicated that no single glycosylation site affected the ability of gp120-Fc to bind DC-SIGN. To further guide our efforts in mapping the DC-SIGN binding sites on gp120, we used two well-characterized HIV inhibitory agents (2G12 monoclonal antibody and cyanovirin) that bind to high-mannose sugars on gp120. We showed that 2G12 and DC-SIGN bound to nonoverlapping sites in gp120 because (i) 2G12 did not block soluble gp120 or virion binding to DC-SIGN, (ii) 2G12 bound to gp120-Fc that was prebound to cell surface DC-SIGN, and (iii) gp120-Fc mutants that lack glycosylation sites involved in 2G12's epitope were also fully capable of binding DC-SIGN. These data were substantiated by the inability of cyanovirin to block gp120-Fc binding to DC-SIGN. Cyanovirin has been shown to effectively compete for 2G12 binding to gp120. Indeed, high concentrations of cyanovirin dramatically enhanced gp120-Fc binding to cell surfaces in the presence or absence of DC-SIGN. We provide evidence that this enhancement may be due to cyanovirin's ability to bridge gp120 to mannosylated cell surface proteins.

We have explored several methods for obtaining fully cleaved Env for use as a vaccine antigen. We tested whether purified Env could be enzymatically digested with purified protease in vitro.

Antibodies to the V3-loop, as well as antibodies that block SIV gp120 binding to CCR5, efficiently neutralized CD4-independent, M-tropic Envs but not the 239 Env. However, triggering the 239 Env with soluble CD4, presumably resulting in exposure of the CCR5 binding site, made it as neutralization sensitive as the M-tropic Envs. In addition, mutations of N-linked glycosylation sites in the V1\/V2 region, previously shown to enhance antigenicity and immunogenicity, made the 239 Env partially CD4 independent. These findings indicate that Env-based determinants of M tropism of these strains are generally associated with decreased dependence on CD4 for entry into cells. Furthermore, CD4 independence and M tropism are also associated with neutralization sensitivity and reduced pathogenicity, suggesting that the humoral immune response may exert strong selective pressure against CD4-independent M-tropic SIVmac strains.

Correspondingly, these mutant CCR5s mediate infections of wild-type virus only at relatively high cell surface concentrations, demonstrating a concentration-dependent assembly requirement for infection. The plots of viral infectivity versus concentration of coreceptors had sigmoidal shapes, implying involvement of multiple coreceptors, with an estimated stoichiometry of four to six CCR5s in the active complexes. All of the adapted viruses had mutations in the V3 loops of their gp120s. The titers of recombinant HIV-1 virions with these V3 mutations were determined in previously described panels of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that express discrete amounts of CCR5(Y14N) or CCR5(G163R). The V3 loop mutations did not alter viral utilization of wild-type CCR5, but they specifically enhanced utilization of the mutant CCR5s by two distinct mechanisms. Several mutant envelope glycoproteins were highly fusogenic in syncytium assays, and these all increased the efficiency of infection of the CCR5(Y14N) or CCR5(G163R) clonal panels without enhancing virus adsorption onto the cells or viral affinity for the coreceptor. In contrast, V3 loop mutation N300Y was selected during virus replication in cells that contained only a trace of CCR5(Y14N) and this mutation increased the apparent affinity of the virus for this coreceptor, as indicated by a shift in the sigmoid-shaped infectivity curve toward lower concentrations. Surprisingly, N300Y increased viral affinity for the second extracellular loop of CCR5(Y14N) rather than for the mutated amino terminus. Indeed, the resulting virus was able to use a mutant CCR5 that lacks 16 amino acids at its amino terminus, a region previously considered essential for CCR5 coreceptor function. Our results demonstrate that the role of CCR5 in infection involves at least two steps that can be strongly and differentially altered by mutations in either CCR5 or the V3 loop of gp120: a concentration-dependent binding step that assembles a critical multivalent virus-coreceptor complex and a postassembly step that likely involves a structural rearrangement of the complex. The postassembly step can severely limit HIV-1 infections and is not an automatic consequence of virus-coreceptor binding, as was previously assumed.

However, while these Envs are commonly dual-tropic, no isolate has been described to date that is CD4 independent on both CXCR4 and CCR5. In this report we show that a variant of HIV-2\/NIHz, termed HIV-2\/vcp, previously shown to utilize CXCR4 without CD4, is also CD4 independent on rhesus (rh) CCR5, but requires CD4 to fuse with human (hu) CCR5. The critical determinant for this effect was an acidic amino acid at position 13 in the CCR5 N terminus, which is an asparagine in huCCR5 and an aspartic acid in rhCCR5. Transferring the huCCR5 N terminus with an N13D substitution to CCR2b or CXCR2 was sufficient to render these heterologous chemokine receptors permissive for CD4-independent fusion. Chimeric Envs between HIV-2\/vcp and a CD4-dependent clone of HIV-2\/NIHz as well as site-directed Env mutations implicated a positively charged amino acid (lysine or arginine) at position 427 in the C4 region of the HIV-2\/vcp env gene product (VCP) gp120 as a key determinant for this phenotype. Because CD4-independent use of CCR5 mapped to a negatively charged amino acid in the CCR5 N terminus and a positively charged amino acid in the gp120 C4 domain, an electrostatic interaction between these residues or domains is likely. Although not required for CD4-dependent fusion, this interaction may serve to increase the binding affinity of Env and CCR5 and\/or to facilitate subsequent conformational changes that are required for fusion.

To study the relationships between CD4 independence, neutralization sensitivity, and exposure of CD4-induced epitopes associated with the coreceptor binding site, we generated a large panel of Env mutants and chimeras between 8x and its CD4-dependent parent, HXBc2. We found that a frameshift mutation just proximal to the gp41 cytoplasmic domain in 8x Env was necessary but not sufficient for CD4 independence and led to increased exposure of the coreceptor binding site. In the presence of this altered cytoplasmic domain, single amino acid changes in either the 8x V3 (V320I) or V4\/C4 (N386K) regions imparted CD4 independence, with other changes playing a modulatory role. The N386K mutation resulted in loss of an N-linked glycosylation site, but additional mutagenesis showed that it was the presence of a lysine rather than loss of the glycosylation site that contributed to CD4 independence. However, loss of the glycosylation site alone was sufficient to render Env neutralization sensitive, providing additional evidence that carbohydrate structures shield important neutralization determinants. Exposure of the CD4-induced epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 17b and which overlaps the coreceptor binding site was highly sensitive to an R298K mutation at the base of the V3 loop and was often but not always associated with CD4 independence. Finally, while not all neutralization-sensitive Envs were CD4 independent, all CD4-independent Envs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to neutralization by HIV-1-positive human sera, indicating that the humoral immune response can exert strong selective pressure against the CD4-independent phenotype in vivo. Whether this can be used to advantage in designing more effective immunogens remains to be seen.","author":"Edwards TG","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.75.11.5230-5239.2001","matches":"mutation"},"11265061":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Algorithms, Amino Acid Sequence, Codon, Computational Biology, Epitope Mapping, Genetic Variation, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV-1, Hemagglutinins, Viral, Influenza A virus, Molecular Sequence Data, Software, Species Specificity","date_submitted":"2001","title":"An algorithm for mapping positively selected members of quasispecies-type viruses.","abstract":"Many RNA viruses do not have a single, representative genome but instead form a set of related variants that has been called a quasispecies.

The Y14N mutation converted a YYT sequence at positions 14 to 16 to an NYT consensus site for N-linked glycosylation, and the mutant protein was shown to be glycosylated at that position. The relationships between HIV-1 infectivity values and CCR5 concentrations took the form of sigmoidal (S-shaped) curves, which were dramatically altered in different ways by these mutations. Both mutations shifted the curves by factors of approximately 30- to 150-fold along the CCR5 concentration axis, consistent with evidence that they reduce affinities of virus for the coreceptor. In addition, the Y14N mutation specifically reduced the maximum efficiencies of infection that could be obtained at saturating CCR5 concentrations. The sigmoidal curves for all R5 HIV-1 isolates were quantitatively consistent with a simple mathematical model, implying that CCR5s reversibly associate with cell surface HIV-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, that approximately four to six CCR5s assemble around the virus to form a complex needed for infection, and that both mutations inhibit assembly of this complex but only the Y14N mutation also significantly reduces its ability to successfully mediate HIV-1 infections. Although several alternative models would be compatible with our data, a common feature of these alternatives is the cooperation of multiple CCR5s in the HIV-1 infection pathway.

Using recombinant vaccinia virus to achieve high-level expression of gp120 in mammalian cells combined with gel filtration analysis, we were able to isolate a discrete oligomeric form of gp120. Oligomerization of gp120 occurred intracellularly between 30 and 120 min after synthesis. Analysis by sedimentation equilibrium unequivocally identified the oligomeric species as a dimer. In order to identify the domains involved in the intersubunit contact, we expressed a series of gp120 proteins lacking various domains and assessed the effects of mutation on oligomeric structure. Deletion of the V1 or V3 loops had little effect on the relative amounts of monomer and dimer in comparison to wild-type gp120. In contrast, deletion of either all or part of the V2 loop drastically reduced dimer formation, indicating that this domain is required for intersubunit contact formation. Consistent with this, the V2 loop of the dimer was less accessible than that of the monomer to a specific monoclonal antibody. Previous studies have shown that while the V2 loop is not an absolute requirement for viral entry, the absence of this domain reduces viral resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies or sera.

The distinct phenotypes of these clones are attributable to six mutations affecting functional interactions between the gp120 C4-V5 regions and the gp41 leucine zipper. In the present study we examined mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic differences between these envelopes using neutralization and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Most monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) tested against gp120 epitopes (V3, CD4 binding site, and CD4-induced) were 20 to 100 times more efficient at neutralizing pseudovirus expressing sensitive rather than resistant envelope. By IFA cells expressing neutralization sensitive envelope bound MAbs to gp120 epitopes more, but gp41 epitopes less, than neutralization-resistant envelope. This binding difference appeared to reflect conformational change, since it did not correlate with the level of protein expression or gp120-gp41 dissociation. This conformational change was mostly attributable to one mutation, L544P, which contributes to neutralization resistance but not to infectivity enhancement. The V420I mutation, which contributes a major effect to both high infectivity and neutralization resistance, had no apparent effect on conformation. Notably, a conformation-dependent V3 neutralization epitope remained sensitive to neutralization and accessible to binding by MAbs on neutralization-resistant HIV-1 envelope. Sensitivity to sCD4 did not distinguish the clones, suggesting that the phenotypes may be related to post-CD4-binding effects.

However, the analysis of gp120-polyanion interactions has been limited to T-cell-line-adapted, CXCR4-using virus and virus-derived gp120, and the polyanion binding ability of gp120 regions other than the V3 loop has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate by monoclonal-antibody inhibition, labeled heparin binding, and surface plasmon resonance studies that a second site, most probably corresponding to the newly defined, highly conserved coreceptor binding region on gp120, forms part of the polyanion binding surface. Consistent with the binding of polyanions to the coreceptor binding surface, dextran sulfate interfered with the gp120-CXCR4 association while having no detectable effect on the gp120-CD4 interaction. The interaction between polyanions and X4 or R5X4 gp120 was readily detectable, whereas weak or undetectable binding was observed with R5 gp120. Analysis of mutated forms of X4 gp120 demonstrated that the V3 loop is the major determinant for polyanion binding whereas other regions, including the V1\/V2 loop structure and the NH(2) and COOH termini, exert a more subtle influence. A molecular model of the electrostatic potential of the conserved coreceptor binding region confirmed that it is basic but that the overall charge on this surface is dominated by the V3 loop.

This virus infected CD4-negative T and B cells and fused with murine 3T3 cells that expressed human CXCR4 alone. A functional IIIBx env clone exhibited several mutations compared to the CD4-dependent HXBc2 env, including the striking loss of five glycosylation sites. By constructing env chimeras with HXBc2, the determinants for CD4 independence were shown to map outside the V1\/V2 and V3 hypervariable loops, which determine chemokine receptor specificity, and at least partly within an area on the gp120 core that has been implicated in forming a conserved chemokine receptor binding site. We also identified a point mutation in the C4 domain that could render the IIIBx env clone completely CD4 dependent. Mutations in the transmembrane protein (TM) were also required for CD4 independence. Remarkably, when the V3 loop of a CCR5-tropic Env was substituted for the IIIBx Env, the resulting chimera was found to utilize CCR5 but remained CD4 independent. These findings show that Env determinants for chemokine receptor specificity are distinct from those that mediate CD4-independent use of that receptor for cell fusion and provide functional evidence for multiple steps in the interaction of Env with chemokine receptors.

CXCR4 is also a receptor for the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The rat CXCR4 cannot mediate infection by HIV-1NDK or by FIVPET (both cell line-adapted strains) because of sequence differences with human CXCR4 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2). Here we made similar observations for HIV-189.6 (a strain also using CCR5) and for a primary HIV-1 isolate. It showed the role of ECL2 in the coreceptor activity of CXCR4 for different types of HIV-1 strains. By exchanging ECL2 residues between human and rat CXCR4, we found that several amino acid differences contributed to the inactivity of the rat CXCR4 toward HIV-189.6. In contrast, its inactivity toward HIV-1NDK seemed principally due to a serine at position 193 instead of to an aspartic acid (Asp193) in human CXCR4. Likewise, a mutation of Asp187 prevented usage of CXCR4 by FIVPET. Different mutations of Asp193, including its replacement by a glutamic acid, markedly reduced or suppressed the activity of CXCR4 for HIV-1NDK infection, indicating that the negative charge was not the only requirement. Mutations of Asp193 and of arginine residues (Arg183 and Arg188) of CXCR4 reduced the efficiency of HIV-1 infection for all HIV-1 strains tested. Other ECL2 mutations tested had strain-specific effects or no apparent effect on HIV-1 infection. The ECL2 mutants allowed us to identify residues contributing to the epitope of the 12G5 monoclonal antibody. Overall, residues with different charges and interspersed in ECL2 seem to participate in the coreceptor activity of CXCR4. This suggests that a conformational rather than linear epitope of ECL2 contributes to the HIV-1 binding site.

Upon analyzing the results on isolated proteins and benchmarking against antibody complexes, it is found that the method successfully identifies binding sites located on the protein surface that are accessible to putative binding partners.

It is proposed here that the usual \"lock and key\" model, with respect to NNRTI drug design, be expanded to consider creating \"master keys\" that would automatically adjust conformations to fit all of the \"locks\" mutations may make. The present work introduces the novel perspective of designing and creating supramolecular assemblies as potential NNRTIs (instead of the relatively more rigid single-molecule inhibitors). Specifically, flexible self-assembling quinhydrone supramolecular dimers formed from quinonoid monomers (designed to be highly flexible NNRTIs themselves) will be offered as a working example of this new perspective in NNRTI drug design. Quinonoid compounds have demonstrated binding interactions at various sites of the HIV-1 RT enzyme, including the elusive ribonuclease H area. Quinhydrone self-organized dimers have at some point in their molecular architecture a noncovalently interacting donor-acceptor ring pair complex. This complex is at the heart of the increased torsional, rotational, and translational motion this species will experience at a particular active site. Flexible supramolecular assemblies, together with their flexible monomer components, may offer a critical advantage in retaining potency against a wide range of drug-resistant HIV-1 RTs.

Misincorporation requires both deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) misinsertion and the subsequent extension of the mismatched terminus thus formed. We hypothesized that Lys66 is a determinant of mismatch extension based on its position near the primer terminus. This hypothesis was tested by steady-state kinetic studies using wild-type HIV-1 RT and four Lys66 substitution mutants: Lys66Arg, Lys66Ala, Lys66Asn and Lys66Thr. The mismatch extension efficiency was reduced for all mutants, with Lys66Ala, Lys66Asn and Lys66Thr showing a four- to six-fold reduction compared with wild-type HIV-1 RT. Surprisingly, the nonconservative substitutions also led to large decreases in misinsertion efficiency, ranging from as low as three-fold to values much higher than 23-fold. Thus, the Lys66Arg mutant was akin to wild-type HIV-1 RT, whereas all nonconservative mutants displayed significantly decreased efficiency for both events. Our results suggest that Lys66, much like Lys65, is a determinant of both dNTP misinsertion and mismatch extension efficiency.

Here, we review these 'antimutagenic' changes in DNA polymerases and discuss what they reveal about mechanisms of replication fidelity. Pioneering studies with bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase (T4 Pol) established the paradigm that antimutator amino acid substitutions reduce replication errors by increasing proofreading efficiency at the expense of polymerase processivity. The discoveries of antimutator substitutions in proofreading-deficient 'mutator' derivatives of bacterial Pols I and III and yeast Pol \u03b4 suggest there must be additional antimutagenic mechanisms. Remarkably, many of the affected amino acid positions from Pol I, Pol III, and Pol \u03b4 are similar to the original T4 Pol substitutions. The locations of antimutator substitutions within DNA polymerase structures suggest that they may increase nucleotide selectivity and\/or promote dissociation of primer termini from polymerases poised for misincorporation, leading to expulsion of incorrect nucleotides. If misincorporation occurs, enhanced primer dissociation from polymerase domains may improve proofreading in cis by an intrinsic exonuclease or in trans by alternate cellular proofreading activities.

As a step toward understanding the mechanism of resistance development and for gaining detailed insights about the active site of the enzyme, we have built a homology model of HDP which is an advance over previously reported ones.

The homology model matched the results of experimental mutation studies of HDP reported in the literature, including those of antiviral-resistant mutations.

V75I is an accessory mutation of the Q151M multidrug resistance complex of HIV-1 RT and is rarely associated with thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs). In vitro, it confers resistance to acyclovir. TAMs confer resistance to zidovudine (AZT) and d4T by increasing the rate of ATP-mediated excision of the terminal nucleotide monophosphate (primer unblocking). In a wild-type HIV-1 group O RT sequence context, V75A and V75M conferred increased excision activity on d4T-terminated primers, in the presence of PP(i). In contrast, V75I decreased the PP(i)-mediated unblocking efficiency on AZT and d4T-terminated primers, in different sequence contexts (i.e. wild-type group M subtype B or group O RTs). Interestingly, in the sequence context of an excision-proficient RT (i.e. M41L\/A62V\/T69SSS\/K70R\/T215Y), the introduction of V75I led to a significant decrease of its ATP-dependent excision activity on AZT-, d4T-, and acyclovir-terminated primers.

Mutations in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT can augment AZT resistance. It has been suggested that these mutations compromise RNase H cleavage, providing more time for AZT excision to occur. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we focused on connection mutations N348I and A360V that are frequently observed in clinical samples of treatment-experienced patients. We show that both N348I and A360V, in combination with TAMs, decrease the efficiency of RNase H cleavage and increase excision of AZT in the presence of the pyrophosphate donor ATP. The TAMs\/N348I\/A360V mutant accumulates transiently formed, shorter hybrids that can rebind to RT before the template is irreversibly degraded. These hybrids dissociate selectively from the RNase H-competent complex, whereas binding in the polymerase-competent mode is either not affected with N348I or modestly improved with A360V. Both connection domain mutations can compensate for TAM-mediated deficits in processive DNA synthesis, and experiments with RNase H negative mutant enzymes confirm an RNase H-independent contribution to increased levels of resistance to AZT. Moreover, the combination of diminished RNase H cleavage and increased processivity renders the use of both PP(i) and ATP advantageous, whereas classic TAMs solely enhance the ATP-dependent reaction. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that distinct, complementary mechanisms can contribute to higher levels of excision of AZT, which in turn can amplify resistance to this drug.","author":"Ehteshami M","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M803521200","matches":"mutation"},"18218633":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Amino Acid Substitution, Cell Line, DNA, Viral, Deoxyribonucleotides, Drug Resistance, Viral, HIV Infections, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Humans, Lamivudine, Macrophages, Mutation, Missense, Protein Structure, Quaternary, Protein Structure, Secondary, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors","date_submitted":"2008 Apr 4","title":"Reduced dNTP binding affinity of 3TC-resistant M184I HIV-1 reverse transcriptase variants responsible for viral infection failure in macrophage.","abstract":"We characterized HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) variants either with or without the (-)-2',3'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant M184I mutation isolated from a single HIV-1 infected patient.

The Ile mutation at position 184 with a longer and more rigid beta-branched side chain, which was previously known to alter the RT-template interaction, also appears to deform the shape of the dNTP binding pocket.

The HIV-1 RT functions as a heterodimer (p66\/p51) composed of subunits of 560 and 440 amino acid residues, respectively. Both subunits have identical amino acid sequence, but p51 lacks 120 residues that are removed by the HIV-1 PR during viral maturation. While p66 is the catalytic subunit, p51 has a primarily structural role. Amino acid substitutions affecting the stability of p66\/p51 (i.e. F130W) have a deleterious effect on viral fitness. Previously, we showed that the effects of F130W are mediated by p51 and can be compensated by mutation T58S.

The reported data suggest that RT pausing due to the low dNTP levels available in the RT reaction mixture facilitates strand transfer, in a process that is not necessarily mediated by nucleotide misinsertion.","author":"Cases-Gonz\u00e1lez CE","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14694133","matches":"mutation"},"12743270":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Antiviral Agents, Binding Sites, Cell Line, DNA Primers, Deoxyadenine Nucleotides, Dideoxynucleotides, Diphosphates, Drug Resistance, Viral, Foscarnet, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Humans, Mutation, Templates, Genetic, Thymine Nucleotides, Zidovudine","date_submitted":"2003 Jun","title":"Relationship between 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine resistance and primer unblocking activity in foscarnet-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase.","abstract":"Phosphonoformate (foscarnet) is a pyrophosphate (PP(i)) analogue and a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), acting through the PP(i) binding site on the enzyme. HIV-1 RT can unblock a chain-terminated DNA primer by phosphorolytic transfer of the terminal residue to an acceptor substrate (PP(i) or a nucleotide such as ATP) which also interacts with the PP(i) binding site. Primer-unblocking activity is increased in mutants of HIV-1 that are resistant to the chain-terminating nucleoside inhibitor 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). We have compared the primer-unblocking activity for HIV-1 RT containing various foscarnet resistance mutations (K65R, W88G, W88S, E89K, S117T, Q161L, M164I, and the double mutant Q161L\/H208Y) alone or in combination with AZT resistance mutations. The level of primer-unblocking activity varied over a 150-fold range for these enzymes and was inversely correlated with foscarnet resistance and directly correlated with AZT resistance. Based on published crystal structures of HIV-1 RT, many of the foscarnet resistance mutations affect residues that do not make direct contact with the catalytic residues of RT, the incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), or the primer-template. These mutations may confer foscarnet resistance and reduce primer unblocking by indirectly decreasing the binding and retention of foscarnet, PP(i), and ATP. Alternatively, the binding position or orientation of PP(i), ATP, or the primer-template may be changed in the mutant enzyme complex so that molecular interactions required for the unblocking reaction are impaired while dNTP binding and incorporation are not.","author":"Meyer PR","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12743270","matches":"mutation"},"12719577":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Binding Sites, DNA Primers, DNA, Viral, DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Humans, Models, Molecular, Mutation, RNA, Viral, RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, Templates, Genetic","date_submitted":"2003 May","title":"Mutations proximal to the minor groove-binding track of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase differentially affect utilization of RNA versus DNA as template.","abstract":"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), like all retroviral RTs, is a versatile DNA polymerase that can copy both RNA and DNA templates. In spite of extensive investigations into the structure-function of this enzyme, the structural basis for this dual template specificity is poorly understood. Biochemical studies with two mutations in HIV-1 RT that affect residues contacting the template-primer now provide some insight into this specialized property. The mutations are N255D and N265D, both adjoining the minor groove-binding track, in the thumb region. The N265D substitution led to a loss of processive polymerization on DNA but not on RNA, whereas N255D drastically reduced processive synthesis on both templates. This differential template usage was accompanied by a rapid dissociation of the N265D variant on DNA but not RNA templates, whereas the N255D variant rapidly dissociated from both templates. Molecular dynamics modeling suggested that N265D leads to a loss of template strand-specific hydrogen bonding, indicating that this is a key determinant of the differential template affinity. The N255D substitution caused local changes in conformation and a consequent loss of interaction with the primer, leading to a loss of processive synthesis with both templates. We conclude that N265 is part of a subset of template-enzyme contacts that enable RT to utilize DNA templates in addition to RNA templates and that such residues play an important role in facilitating processive DNA synthesis on both RNA and DNA templates.","author":"Fisher TS","doi":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12719577","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"12093908":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Base Sequence, Cell Line, DNA, Viral, HIV Long Terminal Repeat, HIV Reverse Transcriptase, HIV-1, Humans, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Mutation, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Ribonuclease H, Substrate Specificity, Transcription, Genetic","date_submitted":"2002 Jul 9","title":"Mutations in the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase affect the initiation of DNA synthesis and the specificity of RNase H cleavage in vivo.","abstract":"Retroviral reverse transcriptases contain a DNA polymerase activity that can copy an RNA or DNA template and an RNase H activity that degrades the viral RNA genome during reverse transcription.

Thus, while biochemical resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49 can be generated in vitro via multiple mutations, the overlap between the aptamer- and template-primer-binding pockets favors mutations that also affect the RT-template-primer interaction.

After transfection into HepG2 cells, HBV DNA isolated from intracellular virus core particles was much higher in 56-transfected cells than in cells transfected with 2-18. The structural basis for the difference in replication efficiency between these two isolates was studied by functional domain gene substitution. The complete polymerase (P) gene and its gene segments coding for the terminal protein (TP), spacer (SP), reverse transcriptase (RT), and RNase H in 2-18 were separately replaced with their counterparts from 56 to construct full-length chimeric genomes. Cell transfection analysis revealed that substitution of the complete P gene of 2-18 with the P gene from 56 slightly enhanced viral replication. The only chimeric genome that regained the high replication efficiency of the original 56 isolate was the one with substitution of the RT gene of 2-18 with that from 56. Within the RT region, amino acid differences between isolates 2-18 and 56 were located at positions 617 (methionine versus leucine), 652 (serine versus proline), and 682 (valine versus leucine). Point mutation identified amino acid 652 as being responsible for the difference in replication efficiency.

It has been clear for some time that there are mutations that selectively interfere with the incorporation of nucleoside analogs; however, it has only recently been proposed that zidovudine (AZT) resistance can involve the excision of the nucleoside analog after it has been incorporated into viral DNA. Although this proposal resolves some important issues, it leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, how do the AZT resistance mutations enhance excision, and what mechanism(s) causes the excision reaction to be relatively specific for AZT? We have used both structural and biochemical data to develop a model. In this model, several of the mutations associated with AZT resistance act primarily to enhance the binding of ATP, which is the most likely pyrophosphate donor in the in vivo excision reaction. The AZT resistance mutations serve to increase the affinity of RT for ATP so that, at physiological ATP concentrations, excision is reasonably efficient. So far as we can determine, the specificity of the excision reaction for an AZT-terminated primer is not due to the mutations that confer resistance, but depends instead on the structure of the region around the HIV-1 RT polymerase active site and on its interactions with the azido group of AZT. Steric constraints involving the azido group cause the end of an AZT 5'-monophosphate-terminated primer to preferentially reside at the nucleotide binding site, which favors excision.","author":"Boyer PL","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.75.10.4832-4842.2001","matches":"mutation, affinity"},"11312349":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Acyclovir, Adenine, Amino Acid Sequence, Antiviral Agents, Cytidine Triphosphate, Deoxycytidine, Dideoxynucleotides, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Guanine, Hepatitis B virus, Humans, Lamivudine, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Organophosphonates, Protein Conformation, RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","date_submitted":"2001 May","title":"Molecular modeling and biochemical characterization reveal the mechanism of hepatitis B virus polymerase resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC).","abstract":"Success in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with nucleoside analog drugs like lamivudine is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains upon prolonged therapy. The predominant lamivudine resistance mutations in HBV-infected patients are Met552IIe and Met552Val (Met552Ile\/Val), frequently in association with a second mutation, Leu528Met. The effects of Leu528Met, Met552Ile, and Met552Val mutations on the binding of HBV polymerase inhibitors and the natural substrate dCTP were evaluated using an in vitro HBV polymerase assay. Susceptibility to lamivudine triphosphate (3TCTP), emtricitabine triphosphate (FTCTP), adefovir diphosphate, penciclovir triphosphate, and lobucavir triphosphate was assessed by determination of inhibition constants (K(i)). Recognition of the natural substrate, dCTP, was assessed by determination of Km values. The results from the in vitro studies were as follows: (i) dCTP substrate binding was largely unaffected by the mutations, with Km changing moderately, only in a range of 0.6 to 2.6-fold; (ii) K(i)s for 3TCTP and FTCTP against Met552Ile\/Val mutant HBV polymerases were increased 8- to 30-fold; and (iii) the Leu528Met mutation had a modest effect on direct binding of these beta-L-oxathiolane ring-containing nucleotide analogs. A three-dimensional homology model of the catalytic core of HBV polymerase was constructed via extrapolation from retroviral reverse transcriptase structures. Molecular modeling studies using the HBV polymerase homology model suggested that steric hindrance between the mutant amino acid side chain and lamivudine or emtricitabine could account for the resistance phenotype. Specifically, steric conflict between the Cgamma2-methyl group of Ile or Val at position 552 in HBV polymerase and the sulfur atom in the oxathiolane ring (common to both beta-L-nucleoside analogs lamivudine and emtricitabine) is proposed to account for the resistance observed upon Met552Ile\/Val mutation. The effects of the Leu528Met mutation, which also occurs near the HBV polymerase active site, appeared to be less direct, potentially involving rearrangement of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding pocket residues. These modeling results suggest that nucleotide analogs that are beta-D-enantiomers, that have the sulfur replaced by a smaller atom, or that have modified or acyclic ring systems may retain activity against lamivudine-resistant mutants, consistent with the observed susceptibility of these mutants to adefovir, lobucavir, and penciclovir in vitro and adefovir in vivo.","author":"Das K","doi":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.75.10.4771-4779.2001","matches":"mutation"},"11274461":{"journal":null,"article_mesh":"Archaea, Catalytic Domain, Crystallography, X-Ray, Escherichia coli, Isoenzymes, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Nucleotidyltransferases, Ribonuclease H, Sequence Alignment, Substrate Specificity, Thermococcus","date_submitted":"2001 Apr","title":"Catalytic center of an archaeal type 2 ribonuclease H as revealed by X-ray crystallographic and mutational analyses.","abstract":"The catalytic center of an archaeal Type 2 RNase H has been identified by a combination of X-ray crystallographic and mutational analyses.
